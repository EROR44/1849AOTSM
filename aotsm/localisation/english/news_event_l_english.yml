 news.292.d:0 "     Today in Constantinople, the premiere of the new novel 'Calibri' by the Hellenic writer Irma Badalinios took place. Calibri tells the story of a Turkish girl named Feride, who had a romance with the Hellenic doctor Konstantin.\n     This literary work caused mixed opinions in the Rhomean Empire: while the Hellenic population praised the novel, the Turkic minority began to protest and call the writer to account for discrediting Turkish family values, since, according to the Constantinople Mufti Ismail Get-oglu, 'Calibri' angered Allah, so the city's Muslims must punish Irma Badalinios. After this, the Rhomean police carried out a series of arrests in the city to prevent acts of vandalism."

The talks, during which Vienna was forced to recognize the northern German territories as belonging to Berlin, lasted 4 hours. Delegates from Britain, France, and Russia were invited.\n       The Basileus congratulated the Berlin government on their victory on the diplomatic front, but the reactions of Britain, France, and Russia were quite cautious, and even they were forced to acknowledge the results of the Frankfurt agreements.

 news.295.d:0 "     After the publication of the 'Communist Manifesto' and the 'Spring of Nations,' disagreements between Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels only grew. The result was their manifesto, which cemented the division of scientific socialism into Marxist and Engelsist currents.\n        Marxists are understood as those ready to overthrow intellectuals and so-called bourgeois for the creation of an equal society by equal efforts and a single revolution.\n     Engelsists advocate for a gradual transition from non-socialist power to a more socially oriented one through reforms and smooth societal transformation. However, neither Marx nor Engels consider themselves 'Marxist' or 'Engelsist,' respectively, as they reject the very notion of ideology as a 'distorted worldview.'"

However, after the Serbian army began its invasion of the same state, everything fell into place. Apparently, Russia has still not decided who is the priority ally in the Balkans.\n\n     Many countries condemned Serbia's invasion, citing the lack of legitimate and internationally recognized claims to Bulgaro-Wallachia. Romea thanked Serbia for the assistance but decided to refrain from sending aid."

And considering the successful invasion by Rhomean forces, Bulgaro-Wallachia had no choice but to accept this peace, though they promised to take revenge in the future.\n     Many outside observers note that the initial idea of the invasion was doomed considering the superiority of the Bulgaro-Wallachian army across all the Balkans."

According to rumors and newspapers in the lands of Judea, a referendum was held aimed at changing the dominant confession in the region. Many might think that Romea now has an Islamic province, but no, they adopted Judaism! It is likely that the connection between the ruling Rhomean dynasty and the Jews may be deeper than mere kinship...\n     Public opinion in many countries is divided, as many are glad that the peoples within Romea's territory can choose their own confession, but the opposing camp believes that the Muslim majority would never have agreed to this. The only country to comment was [CBI.GetName], demanding an end to the genocide of Muslims in Romea's territory."
