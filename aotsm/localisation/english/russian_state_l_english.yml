 #DESCRIPTION

 POLITICS_IVAN_PUSHIN_DESC:0 "Full name: Ivan Ivanovich Pushin \nDate of birth: May 15, 1798 \nPlace of birth: Moscow, Russian Empire \n\nSon of senator A.I. Pushin, educated at the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum, where he befriended A.S. Pushkin.\n\nParticipation in the so-called December Uprising, culminating in the 'Stand on Senate Square,' allowed Ivan Ivanovich to build a solid political career and in February 1830 he replaced S.P. Trubetskoy as President of Russia.\n\nAfter taking office, the politician faced many problems: the Polish-Lithuanian uprising beginning in March 1830, lack of reforms, and general internal instability."

Leader of the centrist group of bureaucrat-Decembrists known as the 'Konstantinovtsy.'\n\nHe was greatly influenced by his tutor, the poet Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky.

He deeply mourned this loss and was one of the few family members to accompany her to burial.\n\nIn subsequent years, his friend from the Lyceum, V.K. Kyukhelbeker, invited him to the 'Green Lamp' society, mainly composed of those disillusioned with the Decembrists. Participation in these meetings greatly influenced and radicalized his positions towards the current government and social order."

 #EVENTS

 rusPol.1.t:0 "End of Political Isolation"
 rusPol.1.d:0 "      The policy of non-intervention no longer makes sense: the leaders of the states [PRU.GetName] and [BYZ.GetName] are increasingly destabilizing the situation in Europe, and if Russia does nothing to prevent possible military conflicts, disaster will follow. At the moment, it is advisable for our country to protect the Austrian Empire at any cost from aggression by the Germans and Byzantines. Disagreements between the Russian government and the Austrian Kaiser must at least temporarily cease. Later, it will be necessary to conclude an alliance with a more reliable potential ally, which will undoubtedly be the Confederation of the British Isles — they were the first to recognize the Decembrist government and have shown no signs of hostility or Russophobia, also possessing one of the greatest fleets in the world. France, although weak militarily, by allying with us, can divert enemy troops to the western theater of war, giving us the opportunity to mobilize and regroup our regiments in time. An alliance with these countries would ensure not only security in Europe but also the possibility for Russia to gain territories in the Transcaucasus, Bosporus, and Dardanelles in the event of a military conflict and victory.\n\n      In this regard, it was decided to declare the country's readiness to defend its interests in Europe. Russia must enter a new era and notify the whole world of its European beginnings."
 rusPol.1.a:0 "At last, we have taken a step closer to cooperation with other European powers!"

 rusPol.2.t:0 "Choosing Supporters"
 rusPol.2.d:0 "      As is known, nowadays one person cannot rule a country without the support of certain social groups, and to implement the country's transformation according to his vision, he needs to secure the support of at least one of them. The success of the Decembrist uprising proved this, so we feel the need to create a base for implementing our political program in the country.\n\n      If we rely on the support of the common people, we can ensure the legitimacy of our state system, but there are objections in the government: relying on the army will not only ensure stability in the state but also accelerate preparation for the upcoming clashes of our homeland's interests with other countries; and relying on the nobility would allow us to carry out more moderate reforms in Russia and ensure stability within it."
 rusPol.2.a:0 "We must secure the support of the people!"
 rusPol.2.b:0 "The nobility will become our allies"
 rusPol.2.c:0 "The army will ensure stability and speed up preparation for upcoming military conflicts"

 rusPol.3.t:0 "Economic Situation"
 rusPol.3.d:0 "      The economic situation in the state is dire: the industrial revolution shook all of Europe much earlier than Russia. Only 14,000 factories have been built across the entire country, almost all railway tracks are still made exclusively of wood, and the government's only significant achievement in this area is the rapid growth of light industry. It is necessary to complete the industrialization of the country to make the Russian economy at least competitive with the economies of other European countries and prepare for upcoming threats.\n\n      There are also reports of unrest in the western regions: a number of legislative restrictions for these areas have led to some dissatisfaction in the country. The strongest resistance to our authority comes from the Finns, who sabotage factories and plants, as well as the Poles, who constantly hold strikes to improve the status of their homeland. The inhabitants of the Baltic principalities and other regions under these restrictions also hold rallies and demonstrations, although less actively. Measures must be taken to ensure the government has the support of certain segments of the population."
 rusPol.3.a:0 " Something must be done about this..."

 rusPol.4.t:0 "President Pushin Resigns"
 rusPol.4.d:0 "      It is becoming increasingly clear that our president's health problems are worsening. Although many once hoped that despite his advanced age he would remain at the helm for many years, nature has taken its course. Due to his frailty and venerable age, Pushin has decided to relinquish the burden of governance and retire with honor, entrusting Russia's fate to younger and more ambitious politicians.\n\n      This step, although met with mixed reactions in Russian society, was received mostly with some regret and deep respect for this worthy act. Not everyone can realize in time when their strength begins to fail and voluntarily step back so as not to harm the state.\n\n      His Excellency's efforts to improve the domestic and foreign political state of the country must not be in vain. Now, in this difficult hour, it is especially important to preserve the unity of the people and ensure stability during the interregnum. To avoid turmoil and discord, the Supreme Council, as an assembly of the wisest men of the Fatherland, will temporarily take up the reins of power until new elections are held and a worthy successor is chosen.\n\n     We can only hope that the coming times will bring Russia new figures as strong in spirit and devoted to its interests, to continue the work begun by the departed ruler."
 rusPol.4.a:0 "Let us not disgrace the memory of His Excellency's merits!"

 rusPol.5.t:0 "Election of a New President"
 rusPol.5.d:0 "       In today's elections, major Russian parties have nominated their candidates for the presidency, although independents also participated in the race, surprising many. According to analysts, the main contenders are:\n\n1. Dmitry Milyutin - candidate from the 'People's Freedom' party, promoting the idea that a strong economy will help the country withstand upcoming conflicts. The party also sees opportunities to reduce the state's financial burden by attracting first domestic and then foreign investments where possible.\n\n2. Konstantin Romanov - heir to the former imperial family and candidate from the 'Council of United Nobility' party. He assured the population that the political course started by Pushin would continue. However, his conservative tendencies raise concerns in society due to the party's campaign program, reminiscent of propaganda for autocratic governance. The 'Council of United Nobility' is primarily composed of nobility.\n\n3. Major General Orlov - independent. A highly popular figure among the military, his position allows him to expand his influence in the country. He advocates for the ideas of a great Russia and Russian identity but lacks broad support among the civilian population.\n\n       Now it is only a matter of time who will receive the majority of votes. However, one thing is certain: the future of Russia lies in the hands of the new president!"
 rusPol.5.a:0 "The new president is §YDmitry Milyutin§!"
 rusPol.5.b:0 "The new president is §2Konstantin Romanov§!"
 rusPol.5.c:0 "The new president is §GMikhail Orlov§!"

 rusPol.6.t:0 "Moscow All-Russian Conference"
 rusPol.6.d:0 "      Today began another conference of countries friendly to Russia in Moscow. Delegates from France, the Confederation of the British Isles, and the Austrian Empire were invited. Issues discussed included establishing economic cooperation against Byzantium, as well as programs for exchanging military technologies and research in other fields. According to official statements, the conference will address key problems of Petrograd: Russia's need for a stronger industry, dissatisfaction with legislation among many peoples, and the elimination of the consequences of serfdom. Trade policies and the expansion of the Northern Sea Route were also discussed."
 rusPol.6.a:0 "Let us hope this will be the beginning of something greater."

 rusPol.7.t:0 "Consequences of Serfdom"
 rusPol.7.d:0 "      In 1831, serfdom was abolished on the condition that peasants were granted land at a rate of 2 dessiatinas per household. However, an average of 4 dessiatinas was needed to feed a peasant family. In fact, large landlord estates were secured. Such actions by the government caused unrest among landlords and peasants — the former were dissatisfied with the acute shortage of free labor, and the latter suffered from land scarcity. This state of affairs in the country cannot last forever.\n\n      Currently, the priority task of our government in domestic policy is to resolve this issue. Different parties and faction leaders propose their solutions to combat this phenomenon."
 rusPol.7.a:0 "We must eliminate the consequences of serfdom!"

 rusPol.8.t:0 "The Issue of Industrial Backwardness"
 rusPol.8.d:0 "      Due to the fact that the industrial revolution occurred in Russia much later than in other European countries, the industry currently consists of only 14,000 factories across the entire country, which is insufficient if we want to make our economy competitive with other European states. Therefore, it was proposed to begin accelerated industrialization, starting with the modernization of existing railway tracks, replacing wooden materials with metal.\n\n      In the coming years, it is planned to proceed based on this proposal, but methods for solving other industrialization issues cause disputes within the government."
 rusPol.8.a:0 "Time will tell which option will be best"

 rusPol.9.t:0 "Problems of National Minorities"
 rusPol.9.d:0 "      Historically, many small peoples in Russia have been subject to various legislative restrictions. As a result, unrest has arisen in the country. The situation was further aggravated by the negative attitudes of some Russians towards them, leading to a number of anti-Polish and anti-Finnish pogroms and the radicalization of certain segments of the population.\n\n      Such actions have provoked the inhabitants of Finland and Poland to take measures to resist Russian authority. The situation in these regions is reaching a boiling point: the growth of local self-awareness increases every day. If nothing is done, sad consequences await us."
 rusPol.9.a:0 "We must fix the situation before it's too late!"

 rusPol.10.t:0 "Conclusion of the Conference"
 rusPol.10.d:0 "      The Moscow conference, attended by delegates from friendly countries, has concluded. Agreements were reached on programs for student exchanges, military technologies and research, as well as economic cooperation aimed at developing Russian infrastructure and industry."
 rusPol.10.a:0 "We must do everything possible to improve the situation in the country"

 rusPol.11.t:0 "Awakening of the Giant"
 rusPol.11.d:0 "      We have proclaimed to the whole world that Russia, so as not to lose its honor, has once again 'concentrated' and is ready to return to the world political stage in all its might. This marks the end of times of humility and avoidance of participation in European affairs, which have vanished like morning mist. From now on, our voice will sound firm and unequivocal, and defending the interests of the state in European matters will become the government's foremost concern.\n\n      This turn in foreign policy is nothing less than a return to the original traditions of the Russian state, which always commanded us to be not a passive observer but an active creator of the world order. Let everyone know that the current generation of rulers no longer intends to tolerate neglect of the honor and benefits of the Fatherland. Russia is ready to once again take its rightful place among the great powers, and woe to those who dare to obstruct it on this path!"
 rusPol.11.a:0 "We still have much work ahead..."

 rusPol.12.t:0 "European Policy"
 rusPol.12.d:0 "Since the time of Peter the Great, Russia has constantly oriented itself towards Europe, trying to adapt its customs into Russian society, which nevertheless exacerbated the country's social stratification — while peasants were never integrated into the new vision of Russia as a European country, the aristocracy became accustomed to speaking foreign languages. It is also worth mentioning that there are those who oppose this state of affairs and call for a more authentic culture. Some particularly conservative people hoped that with the arrival of the Decembrists the situation would change, but this did not happen, as the head of state post was occupied by Trubetskoy.\n\nIn any case, Russia needs allies in such a highly volatile world situation, as a strong alliance is the key not only to the nation's survival but also to asserting its hegemony on the continent."
 rusPol.12.a:0 "Friendship of strong states will withstand any storm..."

 rusPol.13.t:0 "View on Central Asia"
 rusPol.13.d:0 "Russia had complicated relations with the states in Central Asia: persecution of Muslims among Russians took place, as well as a policy of the whip towards the local population — for example, raids on their settlements. However, circumstances have changed. Perhaps now is the time to forget past grievances and begin strengthening the friendship of the countries."
 rusPol.13.a:0 "Do we need such allies?"

 rusPol.14.t:0 "Far Eastern Policy"
 rusPol.14.d:0 "After Russia's exit from political isolation, the question of policy in the Far East arose. Japan — an island state that differs from Russia in some territorial disputes — still has a chance to become an ally in the coming storm. One should not forget China — a vast state in Asia that also has a chance to become a friendly neighbor to Russia, but weaker and stagnating compared to the Japanese. In any case, the region is valuable for expanding influence... or rather developing trade and allied relations in Asia."
 rusPol.14.a:0 "Diplomatic relations should be established with the governments of these countries..."

 rusPol.15.t:0 "Policy in Cromwland"
 rusPol.15.d:0 "The territories Russia holds in Cromwland are poor, although the resources located there are of the highest value. Perhaps, if efforts are not in vain, the Russian government will receive enormous funds from the region for state development. To maintain the trend of further mineral exploration, it is necessary to strengthen our positions there. But caution is needed, as Japan — Russia's main competitor in the region — may commit an act of aggression in northwestern Cromwland, so Russians should be prepared for a full-scale military conflict with it..."
 rusPol.15.a:0 "Long live the Russian era of the region!!!"

 rusPol.16.t:0 "Invitation to the Alliance"
 rusPol.16.d:0 "      Russian diplomats have arrived with a proposal to join the [RUS.GetFactionName] alliance. The envoys from the north, clad in black caftans with gold embroidery, presented their arguments with their characteristic solemnity, pointing to the benefits of joint opposition to common enemies and promising support in military and trade affairs. Now we face a question of great importance: whether to accept their offer to gain a powerful ally, or, exercising caution, to refuse and maintain neutrality to avoid dragging the state into foreign disputes?\n\n      The decision to this dilemma requires a wise and balanced approach, as the consequences of the choice extend far ahead. If we join the [RUS.GetFactionName] alliance, on one hand, we will gain protection from hostile powers, but on the other — risk incurring the wrath of their opponents. If we stay aside, although we avoid immediate threats, we may face loneliness in the coming upheavals. Therefore, all arguments must be carefully weighed so as not to ruin the efforts of our ancestors and not deprive descendants of their rightful heritage."
 rusPol.16.a:0 "Of course, we accept the proposal"
 rusPol.16.b:0 "Now is not the right time"

 rusPol.17.t:0 "Assassination of Trubetskoy"
 rusPol.17.d:0 "The unthinkable has happened: Trubetskoy was found dead in his apartment! Also, based on information from the search, it can be concluded that Sergey Petrovich shot himself, however... he had many enemies and it is quite possible that the alleged 'suicide' was staged by them...\n\nDiscontent with his policies, which failed to fulfill his promises, apparently strongly affected his position in society...\n\nShould we start an investigation into this incident?"
 rusPol.17.a:0 "No question! Start it!"
 rusPol.17.b:0 "He got what he deserved! Whatever it was, let it remain a secret..."

 rusPol.19.d:0 ""
 rusPol.19.a:0 "Excellent"

 rusMil.1.t:0 "Class Privileges"
 rusMil.1.d:0 "Dear Mr. Milyutin, it is unthinkable that at such a time the orders and customs of the old empire persist — the nobility still holds considerable influence in the country. Therefore, it is time to rid ourselves of these relics of the past.\n\nWe must immediately proceed to equalize all citizens in rights, despite the resistance of the most influential stratum of Russian society, which argues that such government actions will provoke social tension in the country and therefore proposes to preserve noble privileges. There is no doubt that you will make the right choice."
 rusMil.1.a:0 "No need to rock the boat"
 rusMil.1.b:0 "It's time to end this relic of tsarism!"

 rusMil.2.t:0 "Fight Against German Influence"
 rusMil.2.d:0 "For a long time, Russia's economy has been somewhat dependent on Germany: goods from the Central European state occupy a considerable place in its trade, and if the situation is not corrected, any kind of confrontation with the German aggressor can be forgotten.\n\nThis must be changed, so efforts should be made to eliminate the influence of other powers in the country's economy, which will allow it to withstand the onslaught of enemies..."
 rusMil.2.a:0 "Let's prepare the country for the coming hardships!"

 rusMil.3.t:0 "Trade War with Germany"
 rusMil.3.d:0 "The government has ensured a strong economy for the country, so Russia is ready for full economic confrontation with Germany. Protective tariffs were introduced on German goods.\n\nAs a result, domestic producers have accelerated their development and began to push German products out of Russian trade. The economy has become more independent of foreign investors, and such restrictions will soon pay off with its improvement."
 rusMil.3.a:0 "This will only benefit us"

 rusMil.4.t:0 "Education Reform Begins to Bear Fruit"
 rusMil.4.d:0 "         The reform carried out three years ago is now beginning to bear its first fruits. Young specialists graduating from schools and technical colleges, as well as those entering institutes, are now starting their work for the benefit of the Fatherland. We are already beginning to reap the fruits of this labor today, and domestic science will soon be able to catch up with developed European countries!"
 rusMil.4.a:0 "Keep up the good work!"

 rusRomKN.1.t:0 "State and Army"
 rusRomKN.1.d:0 "In recent years, the army has been gaining an increasingly important role in the country, and considering that our state needs it as an iron hand, many people in the government have spoken in favor of building a dialogue with it.\n\nAfter all, if we do not even try to come to an agreement with the army, the consequences could be quite critical. The question is whether we should make concessions or try to find a compromise."
 rusRomKN.1.a:0 "We should yield to their demands"

Religion is an integral part of Russian culture, and it would be unwise to refuse support to the faithful, who are numerous in the country, but it is even more questionable to allow them to gain greater influence in the country — a prudent course of action.\n\nNow, we must choose how exactly to proceed on this issue. Should we yield to the church's demands, pressure it, or come to a compromise?"

On the other hand, it was the nobles who raised the uprising on Senate Square, and we owe its success to them.\n\nIn any case, we should secure the support of a certain group of the country's population so that we can pay more attention to carrying out reforms."

Therefore, a policy of centralization should be undertaken to eradicate excessive bureaucracy and develop the regions under the close supervision of Mr. Orlov. This will also allow focusing efforts on preparing the military industry for the coming storm, and in the event of full-scale confrontation with leading European countries, Russia will not only survive but also dictate terms to the defeated..."

 rusOrl.2.t:0 "Negotiations with the Church"
 rusOrl.2.d:0 "For many years, the church has constantly put obstacles in the state's way, but why not use it to create a strong foundation of power? The government must immediately begin seeking compromises for this. The question arises as to what Mr. Orlov intends to do next. In any case, there is no doubt that he will make the right decision..."
 rusOrl.2.a:0 "Well, let's try to negotiate..."

 rusOrl.3.t:0 "Special Powers"
 rusOrl.3.d:0 "Due to the growing global tension provoked by German and Byzantine aggressors, as well as rampant corruption and other internal problems of our Motherland, special powers should be granted to President Mikhail Orlov. Although some residents of Russia fear that these will last indefinitely, the Fatherland needs such measures and a strong leader who will lead the country out of crisis. Therefore, we can sacrifice some Decembrist principles for the survival of the nation in this troubled time."
 rusOrl.3.a:0 "With a firm hand, we will lead the Motherland to greatness!"

 rusOrl.4.t:0 "Fight Against Radicals"
 rusOrl.4.d:0 "As part of the recently launched campaign against corruption and strengthening the government's position, it became clear that measures need to be taken against radically minded political elements. In particular, against the 'Russian Black League' along with its so-called leader — Pavel Ignatiev.\n\nDuring the meeting, several options for action against this group were voiced. Namely:\n\nThe first option is simple but may have negative consequences. It was proposed by the group representing the armed forces and involves aggressive combat against the organization's activities, both propaganda and forceful.\n\nThe second option, unlike the first, is less radical. It was proposed by representatives of the autocratic elite and involves persuading the 'Ignatievites' to join our side, to subsequently use them as attack dogs."
 rusOrl.4.a:0 "This threat must be eliminated!"
 rusOrl.4.b:0 "We will use them for our purposes."
 rusOrl.4.c:0 "The Ignatievites will bring us neither problems nor benefits."

 rusOrl.5.t:0 "Show Arrests"
 rusOrl.5.d:0 "The recently launched campaign against the 'Russian Black League' is yielding its first results. Although only two weeks have passed since its start, officers who recently considered themselves Ignatievites now vehemently deny it.\n\nAccording to reports from the capital police department, about six cells of this organization were uncovered in the capital alone, and around 35 active members were arrested."
 rusOrl.5.a:0 "A terrifying scale!"

 rusOrl.6.t:0 "Hunt for Ignatiev"
 rusOrl.6.d:0 "Since the first show arrests began, the whereabouts of the so-called leader of the 'Russian Black League' remain unknown. He has not been heard from by the service for several weeks, and according to border service data, he has not left the country either. \n\nHowever, we received an anonymous tip about his possible location. According to it, the fugitive officer may be hiding in one of the workers' villages near the 'Dyatkovo Crystal Factory' near Bryansk."
 rusOrl.6.a:0 "Needs to be checked"
 rusOrl.6.b:0 "Sounds like nonsense!"

 rusOrl.7.t:0 "Search of Villages"
 rusOrl.7.d:0 "During searches in one of the workers' villages, a villager recognized the figure in the photograph. According to police information, this person appeared relatively recently and now lives on the outskirts of the village. \n\nThis information did not clarify the case much, and the worker could have been mistaken. However, it might be worth checking the house he indicated?"
 rusOrl.7.a:0 "So, what are we waiting for?"
 rusOrl.7.b:0 "We need to prepare a raid."
 rusOrl.7.c:0 "He was mistaken."

 rusOrl.8.t:0 "House Search"
 rusOrl.8.d:0 "The lights in the house windows were off despite the approaching dusk, giving the impression that no one was home. Nevertheless, the policeman knocked on the door... He waited a few minutes, no answer. Then he pulled the door, and, miracle, it opened. \n\nInside was a small room, barely visible due to lack of lighting. Turning on his flashlight, the officer inspected the room and adjacent ones. Finding nothing noteworthy, he had to leave the house."
 rusOrl.8.a:0 "Apparently, he is not here..."

 rusOrl.9.t:0 "Police Raid"
 rusOrl.9.d:0 "It was decided to establish covert surveillance of the house. It turned out the house was empty most of the time, but a man resembling Ignatiev did sometimes appear there. He usually came at dusk with workers and left late at night. Where he was the rest of the time remained unknown...\n\nWell, it is time to catch the fellow. Once again, the operational group watched a strange figure entering the house and sitting at the table. However, this time he was not destined to stay long.\n\nNight fell... the person was still sitting at the table, sorting through some papers... But now it was time to act! The police quietly surrounded the house and burst inside.\n\nThe police quickly approached him; the man tried to draw a pistol but was disarmed. Under the lamp light, his face became clear — it was indeed Ignatiev. Disheveled, unshaven, with bruises under his eyes, but he was the leader of the 'Russian Black League.'"
 rusOrl.9.a:0 "What have you become, Pavel!"

 rusOrl.10.t:0 "Ignatiev Spotted at the Kazakhstan Border"
 rusOrl.10.d:0 "Today we received a report from one of the border posts near Guryev. According to its content, a group of individuals engaged in a firefight with border troops. At first, everything proceeded normally, but when it came to checking documents, the individuals simply drew weapons and demanded to be allowed across the border without document inspection.\n\nThe result of this event was the crossing of the border by the aforementioned criminal group, as well as significant losses among the personnel of the border post. According to received data, all present clearly identified one of the attackers as Pavel Ignatiev."
 rusOrl.10.a:0 "Apparently, now we won’t catch him..."

 rusOrl.11.t:0 "Negotiations with Ignatiev"
 rusOrl.11.d:0 "Pavel received the proposal to serve his Fatherland positively. According to him, neither his goals nor those of the 'Russian Black League' ever threatened Russia and its statehood, and he and his subordinate organization are ready to help and serve the Fatherland.\n\nAccording to the agreements reached, the Ignatievites are ready to assist us in the following areas:\n\n1. On the battlefield and in the rear, by forming full brigades to carry out missions behind enemy lines, at the front, and within the vast Motherland.\n\n2. Supporting the country’s intelligence activities and creating official reconnaissance units from members of the organization.\n\nNow we face a difficult choice regarding how exactly to use them..."
 rusOrl.11.a:0 "Military support will definitely be beneficial."
 rusOrl.11.b:0 "Reconnaissance missions will be preferable"

 rusOrl.12.t:0 "Local Resistance"
 rusOrl.12.d:0 "Many provincial officials live in abundance thanks to the flourishing corruption. The reforms we have started clearly contradict their interests, and now in many regions large sums of money are concentrated in the hands of bribe-takers, hindering the reform process and economic growth.\n\nSuch a farce must be ended by thoroughly auditing the income of the entire government apparatus to remove funds from wrong hands."
 rusOrl.12.a:0 "Let’s continue the fight."

 rusOrl.13.t:0 "Church Propaganda"
 rusOrl.13.d:0 "Now that the Orthodox Church and the state have reached a compromise, it has become possible to use the church as a tool to influence the masses. This way, the authority of the center can be increased, as well as unite the people around the government.\n\nHowever, how ethical it is to act this way and manipulate public consciousness is questionable. There is no definite answer, but we believe Mikhail Orlov will make the right choice."
 rusOrl.13.a:0 "That’s what we’ll do!"
 rusOrl.13.b:0 "The decision is doubtful and unethical..."

 rusOrl.14.t:0 "Representation of the ROC in Government"
 rusOrl.14.d:0 "At today’s meeting with representatives of the Orthodox Church, an unusual issue was raised. The representatives expressed the Patriarch’s desire to have representation in the Fatherland’s government. None of those present at that moment had the authority to discuss such a matter, so it is passed on to you.\n\nOn one hand, this decision will reduce bureaucratic expenses in relations with clergy and allow conveying wishes directly. However, on the other hand, such activity will allow the church to increase its influence on the government and expand its opportunities."
 rusOrl.14.a:0 "Let them have what they require."
 rusOrl.14.b:0 "Too risky..."

 rusOrl.15.t:0 "Membership in the 'Black League'"
 rusOrl.15.d:0 "Today there was another meeting of two old men in Ignatiev’s mansion, the details of which few knew....\n - Mr. Orlov, we have been working together for a long time, and it would be good to formalize our cooperation, - said the elderly-looking man.\n - Let me guess, you want to offer me membership in your secret society? - Orlov asked Ignatiev.\n - Indeed, as I have already noted, our relations are very fruitful, and to list you as enemies would be costly for me...\n  - Please give me time to think - Alright, in that case, I will eagerly await your obviously positive response.\n\nFive minutes later, an answer was given to this proposal:"
 rusOrl.15.a:0 "Well, I dare not refuse in that case!"
 rusOrl.15.b:0 "Unfortunately, I must decline..."

 rusOrl.16.t:0 "Faction Split"
 rusOrl.16.d:0 "A heated discussion arose in the ministers' office about how to respond to the recent event. A split occurred within the Russian Black League because some of its members disagree with Ignatiev's actions — we should exploit their weakness by taking an active stance to gain advantage, advised the president's advisor.\n\n - However, the question arises whether we should go so far, as there is a risk that this will only strengthen the Russian Black League's position, and I would not want to repeat Tsar Nicholas's mistake by strengthening this 'secret' organization's power... - His Excellency replied.\n\n - Still, consider my proposal — after all, if we decide not to destroy it, it is better to lead its control and place our man there.\n\n - Are you sure he will be a reliable appointee of our government? Besides, I wouldn't want people to find out that we are aware of their so-called 'secret' activities...\n\n - Don't worry about that, and I wouldn't have proposed his candidacy otherwise...\n\n - It seems you have something planned, but if you try to deceive me — you will regret it greatly... Still, I need a few minutes to think.\n\n - Well, I hope you make the right decision...\n\nThirty minutes passed, and the president decided that it is better..."
 rusOrl.16.a:0 "...to agree"
 rusOrl.16.b:0 "...to abandon the dubious plan"

 rusOrl.17.t:0 "Mikhail Orlov — New Leader of the 'Black League'"
 rusOrl.17.d:0 "Mikhail Orlov became the new head of the Russian Black League, and Ignatiev himself lost his important positions in it, which shocked many people. Its new leader has already declared that the Great Judgment is near and that we should prepare for a war unlike any seen before. To the surprise of many, the entire nation's people supported this speech of a very promising and ambitious leader — only time will tell what he truly represents..."
 rusOrl.17.a:0 "Excellent"

 rusOrl.18.t:0 "Ignatiev Retained Positions"
 rusOrl.18.d:0 "A heavy atmosphere hung in the secret temporary headquarters of the Russian Black League... So, gentlemen, you are aware that we must not show weakness, or we will be unable to protect the country from the impending danger? Yes, I am talking about those weaklings who indulge the vision of a defective man! — Ignatiev loudly declared.\n\nIndignant shouts began among the members of the organization — the matter almost escalated to a fight, but the leader of the Black League managed to calm the crowd in time.\n\nPlease calm down so we can discuss this situation. It seems some do not understand the position they are in...\n\nDo not take this as insolence, but this kind of thinking resembles youthful maximalism since you accept only your opinion and consider others wrong, — said von Kaufman.\n\nI am very sorry we could not reach consensus, but it is important to consider — no one in our secret society should yield, — Ignatiev cut in, — in general, this is akin to betrayal...\n\nWhat nonsense?! We act based on the main idea of the Russian Black League, and it is very strange that you simply do not notice this! Have ambitions blinded your reason?! — suddenly burst out Gurko.\n\nYou may think whatever you want about me, but the fact remains — you and your associates are traitors to everything we stand for and are ready to die for... But I am very merciful towards all Russian people, so I propose, gentlemen, that you become commanders of some atonement brigades, the organization of which is my idea.\n\n\"Well, it seems this bastard is aiming for...\" — thought von Kaufman, — \"...but that no longer matters — better to try to reach an agreement with him...\"\n\nApparently, he has calculated everything already, and it would be foolish to go against him now — let's try to reach a compromise, — whispered Gurko to von Kaufman.\n\nI agree, — he replied.\n\nWe agree to forget all disputes if we get some control over the armed forces, — said von Kaufman to Ignatiev.\n\nI cannot offer that, but my original proposal still stands, — said the Black League leader. In that case, we intend to accept it, — replied Gurko."
 rusOrl.18.a:0 "Glad we could agree... — said Ignatiev"

 rusOrl.19.t:0 "Coup d'État"
 rusOrl.19.d:0 "Sensational events are unfolding today — the Ignatievites have begun seizing many government buildings, banks, and even attempting to destroy many railways and bridges in Petrograd. The situation is extremely tense, but neither side wishes to shed the blood of their fellow citizens, although the Russian government has not commented on this.\n\nArmy patrols are being introduced across all regions to combat unrest, yet many believe the rebels have connections with people holding important posts in the government. After all, the Russian government..."

 rusOrl.20.t:0 "Arrest of Ignatiev"
 rusOrl.20.d:0 "Mr. Ignatiev — a man who acted from the shadows and founder of the secret organization 'Russian Black League' — has finally revealed his true intentions.\n\nPavel Nikolaevich — a power-hungry nobleman nostalgic for the times of the old empire. His attempt to stage a coup due to the 'weakness' of the new government is direct proof of this. It seems he does not understand the consequences their rebellion could have led to, so Mr. Ignatiev should be judged with the full severity of our laws to avoid becoming like the Black Leaguers.\n\nPavel Nikolaevich Ignatiev deserves an inglorious end — there will be no mentions of him in newspapers, he will not be honored as a hero-martyr, he will rot in prison for the rest of his life..."

 rusOrl.21.t:0 "What to Do with the 'Ignatievites'?"
 rusOrl.21.d:0 "After the failure of the Ignatievites' rebellion, a question arose in the government about how to deal with the members of the Russian Black League. A heated discussion began:\n\n - Mr. President, that was the last straw, so I advise you to take action, - said the Minister of Internal Affairs.\n\n - Indeed, sitting idly by is not an option, and I would like to know what you propose...\n\n - No offense, but in my opinion, it’s simple — we need to officially recognize the dissolution of this problematic organization.\n\n - However, this would only show all of Russian society that we are aware of the existence of the Russian Black League.\n\n - Don’t worry, no problems will arise...\n\n - But they will! - His Excellency immediately interrupted the minister.\n\n - In that case, maybe you have your own plan? - smugly replied the man who proposed the idea that seemed crazy to the president.\n\n - Oh, no need to worry about that, because I already know what to do — if you can’t beat them, lead them!\n\n - That’s madness! An incredibly stupid idea that will only strengthen these insane sectarian Black Leaguers!\n\n - Really? I don’t think so — moreover, reorganizing them will be much more beneficial, and if we can’t control them — we will destroy them from within, which is clearly impossible with the official dissolution of the 'secret organization'...\n\n - Well, you are convinced of your correctness, and I of mine, and there is no time for disputes, so I propose to put this issue to a vote...\n\n - At least we agree on something...\n\nIn the end, the decision was made..."

 rusOrl.22.t:0 "Unrest in the Provinces"
 rusOrl.22.d:0 "Unrest has begun in the provinces — the Ignatievites strike blow after blow, looting and destroying many already poor regions of the country...\n\nIf this continues — if it becomes the norm — disaster will follow.\n\nThe growth of discontent in Russian society will lead not only to low government support but also to decreased stability throughout the country and, consequently, to ineffective operation of many vital state sectors.\n\nThis cannot continue, but a question arose in the government whether to increase police patrols in the provinces or not: on the one hand, this will help ensure the safety of settlements from terrorist raids, but on the other — it will increase state control over society, which may be perceived very negatively by our people — thereby potentially strengthening the Russian Black League, which is highly undesirable...\n\nIn any case, the final decision rests with the president..."
 rusOrl.22.a:0 "Increase patrols!"
 rusOrl.22.b:0 "We are not tyrants and therefore will not monitor our citizens..."

 rusOrl.23.t:0 "Unrest Intensifies"
 rusOrl.23.d:0 "Because we did not increase police patrols in the provinces, unrest in the country has only intensified.\n\nIt is now clear that if nothing is done, this will lead to unforeseen and dire consequences, so the question of stabilizing the regions with the support of state structures was no longer relevant — instead, disputes arose in the government about whom to send to solve this problem: many in the government argue that a professional army is much better suited for this since the situation is already getting out of control and no police unit, even the most elite, can handle it. However, those who argue that deploying the army to suppress discontent will only worsen the situation and terrorists will certainly take advantage of this still intend to solve the problem using a structure that enforces laws in such cases.\n\nIn any case, the president has already made a decision..."
 rusOrl.23.a:0 "...to eliminate any manifestations of terrorism by the power of the Law"
 rusOrl.23.b:0 "...to crush terrorists at all costs"

 rusOrl.24.t:0 "Unrest Quelled"
 rusOrl.24.d:0 "The president’s competent actions led to the rapid arrest of many figures responsible for provoking unrest — with no more reasons for rebellion and its provocateurs, the unrest quickly subsided.\n\nThe Russian government showed the whole world that it is capable of acting within its own laws (without rewriting them) and handling such difficulties without resorting to violence against the guilty, which is quite surprising for a 'barbaric' country. Now many of the guilty rot in prison awaiting their verdict, but one thing is certain — this will be the most high-profile trial in the country’s history..."
 rusOrl.24.a:0 "Long live our court! The most humane court in the world!"

 rusOrl.25.t:0 "Execution of the Guilty"
 rusOrl.25.d:0 "The president issued a decree to suppress unrest using the professional army, stating that it should act at its discretion.\n\nThis led to a swift resolution of the rebellion, but was it worth it? Reports indicate numerous executions of Ignatievites and those simply caught in the wrong place. These controversial methods led to condemnation of our government not only by Russian but also by the entire world community.\n\nLet’s hope such a situation never repeats..."
 rusOrl.25.a:0 "Finally, it’s all over..."

 rusOrl.26.t:0 "Reorganization of the 'Black League'"
 rusOrl.26.d:0 "In the end, the solution to the Black Leaguers’ problem proposed by the president himself was chosen.\n\nThe reorganization of the structure of the Russian Black League itself and its direct subordination to state institutions will serve us well since we will know all the internal affairs of this 'secret' organization and, in case of disobedience, will be able to destroy the Black League from within. Still, not many people should know about this event; otherwise, we won’t be able to monitor the sentiments of our people from time to time..."

You might think it’s time to stop? But Germany was not satisfied with uniting historical territories; it decided to completely erase Austria from the face of the earth. We endured all these acts of aggression, all the unrest in Western Europe, as it only affected us indirectly so far, but when Germany decided to support the half-dead movement of the cursed Poles, promising to protect their independence from any threats...

 russian_far_east_politic.1.t:0 "Far Eastern Claims"
 russian_far_east_politic.1.d:0 "We should begin expanding our borders in the Far East, as we have an urgent need for ice-free ports in this region. The port of Okhotsk is difficult to access for regular navigation, and the port of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky is located in the remote northern part of the Pacific basin. We should also not forget the logistical advantages—the transport artery on the Amur is needed for the development of new lands in the region.\n\nThe problem is that these territories belong to the Qing Empire, but now we have a chance to acquire them. The empire has recently stagnated, causing it to lag far behind developed countries like ours. Here our government comes into play—we just need to buy these territories from the Chinese. We can try to pressure the Qing government by issuing an ultimatum—Northern Manchuria or war. Is this risk worth it?\n\nThere is also the option to buy the Priamurye region—we can spend little money and acquire territory to facilitate movement in the Far East, as well as begin establishing and improving diplomatic relations with China.\n\nThe last option involves buying Priamurye and Khaishenwei—at a medium price we can acquire an ice-free port and optimize movement in the Far East.\nYour Excellency, what are our actions?"
 russian_far_east_politic.1.a:0 "Let's try to buy Priamurye"
 russian_far_east_politic.1.b:0 "Buying Northern Manchuria and Khaishenwei is the optimal option!"

 russian_far_east_politic.2.d:0 "Diplomats from Russia have arrived to buy the Priamurye territory. Although the Russians, like any other Europeans, should bow deeply to us, their offer should be considered. Perhaps they are different from the others. They promise us a rather decent sum... and is it worth keeping a territory that we do not manage very well? On the other hand, it must be admitted that these savages can be quite cunning, and we should keep our distance from them."
 russian_far_east_politic.2.a:0 "We still need the money..."

Although losing it will be a problem for us, it is better to sacrifice Northern Manchuria for the good of the Chinese people. On the other hand, these savages have no right to come here with such proposals, so they must prepare for the consequences of their foolish actions...\n\nIn any case, Emperor, we hope for your wisdom..."

 russian_far_east_politic.14.d:0 "Recently, our relations with the Qing government have begun to improve, which is encouraging. We should take advantage of this opportunity if we want to conduct trade in the Chinese region. This will allow us to solidify the friendship between our states now at an economic level. This mutually beneficial cooperation will also help free China from economic isolation; provide us access to local exotic products and duty-free movement of Russian-Chinese goods between us and the Qing, so let us hope our efforts to establish trade relations will not be in vain."
 russian_far_east_politic.14.a:0 "So what are we waiting for? Send the delegation!"

 russian_far_east_politic.15.t:0 "Trade with Russia"
 russian_far_east_politic.15.d:0 "A Russian delegation has arrived to negotiate a trade agreement. Such actions by Russia indeed make one think that they recognize our government—they help cope with the economic crisis and seek to establish friendly relations with us; however, this can also be seen as an encroachment by the Russians on our trade—they likely aim to make us dependent on Russia. This is a difficult issue, but we count on Your wisdom, Emperor."
 russian_far_east_politic.15.a:0 "The economy will strengthen at their expense, and the Russians will get duty-free access to our goods—a mutually beneficial exchange! We agree!"
 russian_far_east_politic.15.b:0 "Still, our economy must be independent, so we cannot accept this agreement. Politely refuse them."

 russian_far_east_politic.17.t:0 "Diplomats Rejected"
 russian_far_east_politic.17.d:0 "Our delegation has returned with bad news—the Chinese refused to conclude trade agreements, citing the need for the country's economic sovereignty, as they want to become the ones who lead Asia to peace and prosperity—a strong friendly state towards us."
 russian_far_east_politic.17.a:0 "Well, it's their choice, and we have no right to insist..."

 russian_far_east_politic.18.t:0 "Russo-Japanese Relations"
 russian_far_east_politic.18.d:0 "     Relations between the two countries have developed in an interesting way. In the first half of the 19th century, Russia, freed from autocratic oppression, sought to establish friendly ties with other states, including Japan. Amid the abolition of serfdom and the drive for modernization, Russian leaders sought allies in Asia, seeing Japan as a potential partner for economic cooperation and cultural exchange. The Japanese leadership, under the rule of the Mitsunari family, also showed interest in strengthening ties with Russia, viewing it as an important player in the region.\n\n     The current situation between these two states remains complex but promising: Russia, continuing its course of modernization and reforms, sees in Japan an example of successful combination of traditional values and modern technologies. Both countries are interested in developing economic ties, especially in energy and high technology. However, unresolved issues remain concerning historical conflicts and territorial claims, which may hinder further rapprochement.\n\n     There are two main scenarios. The first involves intensifying dialogue and strengthening cooperation between Russia and Japan. This could lead to joint projects in economy, science, and culture, as well as resolving contentious issues such as the status of the Kuril Islands and Karafuto Island. The second scenario involves maintaining existing tensions and possibly escalating conflict if historical claims and political ambitions prevail over the desire for peace and cooperation. The choice between these paths depends on Your Excellency's decision."
 russian_far_east_politic.18.a:0 "There is no need to shed Russian blood unnecessarily."

 russian_far_east_politic.19.d:0 "     Honorable Mr. Emperor,\n\n     We are pleased to inform you that a diplomatic mission from Russia is arriving. They come with the purpose of establishing and strengthening friendly relations between our countries. They claim their visit aims to deepen cooperation in various fields, including economy, culture, science, and education.\n\n     The Russian delegation consists of experienced diplomats, commercial figures, and scholars ready to discuss various aspects of our interaction. We are confident that joint efforts will allow us to achieve significant progress in developing our states and improving the welfare of our peoples.\n\n     This visit may become an important step toward further strengthening friendship and mutual understanding between Russia and Japan, but we also know that Japan is capable of handling all difficulties on its own.\n\n     In any case, the final word is yours."
 russian_far_east_politic.19.a:0 "We need an ally in Europe."
 russian_far_east_politic.19.b:0 "We should not dirty our hands with these savages."

We are confident that our partnership will make a significant contribution to the development and prosperity of both countries, as well as strengthen stability in the region. Let's see what comes of it..."

Wouldn't we become the laughingstock of the whole world? There is nowhere left to retreat, so it is worth starting a military campaign..."

Therefore, it is necessary to expand these territories to the south.\n\nThere is a chance that what we need for the survival and independence of the nation lies there.

Moscow, as a city in central European Russia, could serve as a good stimulus for economic relations.\n\n2. On the other hand, Petrograd is close to maritime borders and may be threatened by enemy fleets, but some believe it would be wise to develop this city.\n\n3.

Tula is quite far from neighboring states' borders, which is positive for us in a defensive war—capturing this region would cause problems for the enemy.\n\n2. Smolensk, on the contrary, is closer to neighboring borders and in an offensive war aimed at a preemptive strike, logistics will be smooth, but if the enemy gains the initiative and we must defend, Smolensk may be captured, and the factories we built could fall into enemy hands.\n\n3. Petrograd is the most optimal option, being at a sufficient distance from many borders, and in case of initiative shift or advantage, army logistics will not suffer much.

This may seem too long, but we are confident the efforts will pay off... Therefore, it is not surprising that his project, which includes freedom of religion, a federal (state) structure of the country, freedom of speech, and equality of all citizens before the law, seems an obvious and reasonable choice.\n\nThe second option—the project of S.P. Polivanov, which implies transparency of courts, local elections, granting peasants ownership of peasant, state, monastery, and half-landlord lands without the right to buy or sell, and factories and plants to workers. However, the form of government was not specified...\n\nThe third option—considered too radical by some and, let's say, brilliant by others—is G.A. Lopatin's project, which involves abolishing private property—nationalizing enterprises and other sectors—and establishing a unitary form of government.\n\nAll three options were put to a popular referendum.

But this will clearly not benefit our relations with people of liberal views. Moreover, the poor climate in the city makes us consider moving the capital...\n\nIt was also proposed to move the capital to Moscow—the city has important strategic significance: in case of invasion and further advance on our territory, the enemy will simply tire reaching Moscow. An invasion from the sea or air will become nearly impossible. Besides military goals, it should be noted that the new capital will play an important role in the country's economy and, ultimately, be a symbol of unity, being practically at the center of our Motherland. Although this decision will not please the most conservative layers of the population...\n\nThere is a third option, previously proposed in Muravyov's project—to move the capital to Nizhny Novgorod, renaming the city Slavensks. Supporters of this third option claim it will symbolize that the country has finally decided to pave the way to the future for the prosperity of its citizens and follow Muravyov's legacy.

Suddenly, his thoughts were interrupted:\n\n'Your Excellency! The head of the Separate Military Police Corps (SMPC), the equivalent of the Imperial Gendarmerie, has arrived by your order!'\n\n'At ease,' replied the dictator. 'What do you think, Mr. Kalyatkin, should we finally renounce the tsarist past or should this page of history remain untouched so that our descendants come to their own conclusions?'\n\n'With your permission,' began the head of the SMPC, 'with all due respect, I believe the question is posed incorrectly, because sharp changes and renouncing our own history would characterize us as rather illiterate and hypocritical people unwilling to remember the lessons of the past.'\n\n'You are honest with me, and that is what I value in you, Mr. Kalyatkin, but do you really want to leave everything as it is?' asked His Excellency.\n\n'Of course not,' the head immediately replied.\n\n'Then what do you propose?'\n\n'Changes can begin smoothly, without renouncing our history itself, but at the same time starting a gradual transition to a new era in Russia.'\n\n'Well, I am glad we come to common conclusions, but that does not mean the population will not perceive such a step as a sign of weakness, so I still need to think about it...'\n\nThe next day His Excellency concluded that..."

 rus_propaganda_and_reneim_event.4.d:0 "Over the past year, the propaganda campaign gained significant momentum. The main focus was on spreading ideas of constitutional reforms through various information channels. Leaflets, proclamations, and literature became the primary tools influencing public opinion.\n\nThe campaign’s results exceeded all expectations: among the educated classes, interest in government ideas noticeably increased, especially among youth and intellectuals. In some regions, open discussions and demonstrations related to political freedoms and citizens’ rights were recorded. However, a broad popular movement did not form, and support among the peasantry remained at the same level. This is explained by weak propaganda penetration into rural areas and the lack of a clear and understandable program of action for the wider population."

Over the past year, he achieved significant success in attracting public attention to the need for reforms and the role of the Decembrists in improving the country. Ideas of combating the consequences of serfdom and introducing constitutional freedoms became especially popular.\n\nThanks to active propaganda, we secured the support of a significant part of the intelligentsia and progressive youth. Contacts were also established with some influential political figures, allowing them to strengthen their influence in society. However, despite these successes, conservative forces continue to strongly resist, hindering reform implementation.

 rus_propaganda_and_reneim_event.6.d:0 "The government’s campaign to promote citizen enlightenment regarding reforms concluded successfully due to a series of measures taken by the authorities. First, censorship was relaxed, allowing the widespread distribution of literature and leaflets authored by the Decembrists. Additionally, the authorities intensified the work of the SMPC, which identified many protest participants and spread government ideas into rural areas.\n\nAs a result, the government’s popularity increased. The people began to realize the danger of halting reforms and started trusting the government more. This led to the ruling party becoming more popular and their influence on society strengthening. Thus, government propaganda achieved its goal—stabilizing the situation in the country and preventing unrest from conservative factions."

The main efforts were directed at spreading the idea of national unity and cultural rapprochement with Russia. Various methods were used, including publishing newspapers and magazines in Polish, organizing cultural events, and supporting local initiatives.\n\nSpecial attention was given to working with the youth, involving them in various public organizations and student unions. These organizations helped form a positive image of Russia and its policies. However, despite all efforts, the campaign’s results were mixed. The local population retained a strong attachment to their national traditions and culture, which complicates the integration process into Russian society."

The main focus was on strengthening ties between Finnish society and Russian culture. Tools included opening schools with instruction in Finnish and Russian, organizing cultural events such as exhibitions and balls, and publishing materials in the local press highlighting the benefits of cooperation with Russians.\n\nDespite significant efforts, the results were mixed. While some segments showed interest in Russian cultural initiatives, a large part of the Finns continued to maintain their national identity and autonomy. This created challenges for full integration of Finland into the Russian political system. Nevertheless, the government continued to develop a strategy of engagement with the local population, hoping for gradual strengthening of its position in the region."

Key methods included cultural and educational events, creation of Russian-language educational institutions, and active use of mass media. Special attention was paid to publishing articles and brochures explaining the benefits of cooperation with Russians and showcasing achievements of Russian culture and science.\n\nThe results of this campaign were satisfactory. Although there was some increase in pro-Russian sentiment among the local elite, most of the population retained their national traditions and culture. Progress in integration was visible, and for the inhabitants, maintaining national identity became a secondary issue, which facilitated the full subjugation of the Baltics.

Special attention was given to policies addressing the consequences of serfdom, which resonated strongly with the peasant population.\n\nAdditionally, numerous public lectures and meetings were organized to discuss the benefits of constitutional governance and freedom of speech. These events attracted many city residents, indicating growing interest in our ideas. Successful cooperation with local public organizations further supported our propaganda efforts.\n\nDespite these achievements, much remains to be done to strengthen our movement’s position.

Despite active efforts, public reaction was mixed. Some residents supported the Decembrists’ initiatives, seeing them as a chance to improve life. However, many remained skeptical, fearing radical changes and possible consequences.

Local press actively published articles explaining the necessity of reforms and their benefits for locals. However, reactions were mixed: some supported new initiatives seeing opportunities for improving their lives, while a significant part of the Cossacks remained wary, fearing loss of privileges and traditional independence.

Local press actively published materials explaining the significance of ongoing reforms and their potential benefits for the population.

One possible new name is Barabinsk, reflecting the city’s geographic location in the Baraba Steppe. This name emphasizes the region’s natural uniqueness and historical significance for Siberia. Adopting this name would highlight the secular nature of modern society and eliminate possible associations with past religious conflicts.\n\nAnother renaming option is Ryleev, which could immortalize the memory of Decembrist Kondraty Ryleev, an important figure in the struggle for freedom and human rights. Naming the city after Ryleev would emphasize the pursuit of free thought and independence, as well as remind of the fight for civil liberties, which remains relevant today.\n\nThe choice between these two options depends on which values and historical aspects we want to emphasize in the city’s future name."

Yaroslavl, as a symbol of former glory, no longer reflects the reality of our time and needs a new, more modern name embodying the spirit of renewal and progress.\n\nOne option could be the name Rubleny, symbolizing the beginning of a new era in the city’s history, combining ancient traditions with modern realities. This symbolism focuses on the key historical point—the Strelka cape, where the Volga and Kostroma rivers meet, creating a unique space for development.\n\nAnother possible name is Kahovsk. This name also carries connotations of power and greatness but is less connected to the country’s monarchical history, as it commemorates the fight against tsarism, which would be more appropriate for today’s Russia, striving for democratic and progressive changes. These new name options will help the city gain a new identity and become a symbol of change in public consciousness."

References to historical figures such as Catherine II evoke mixed feelings among citizens. In this context, several alternative names have been proposed to reflect deeper roots and the nature of the region.\n\nOne of the most logical options is Dnepr, named after the great river that flows through the city. This option emphasizes the connection to nature and local traditions, which may attract both residents and tourists.\n\nAnother interesting proposal is Novy Kodak, named after the settlement of Kodak that existed on this site before the 15th century. This name restores the city’s historical roots and highlights the rich cultural heritage that must be valued and preserved for future generations.

Mentions of the imperial dynasty in the city’s name evoke mixed reactions in modern society. This is not just a renaming issue but a symbolic act that could mark the beginning of a new historical path.\n\nChanging the city’s name could deepen the understanding and appreciation of local historical traditions. For example, returning to a name related to the Iset River could emphasize the uniqueness of the place and draw attention to local culture. Unlike imperial symbolism, such a name would help create a new identity reflecting true values and the spirit of the region, freeing public consciousness from echoes of the monarchical past.\n\nAs a result, renaming Yekaterinburg would not only rid us of unnecessary associations but also open new horizons for development and self-awareness, allowing us to build a future based on our own history and culture."

On the other hand, historical roots and geographical features of the region must be considered as a basis for a new name.\n\nOne proposed renaming option is Vitkurevsk, after the Vitkurya River flowing in the Arkhangelsk region. This name could symbolize a connection to nature and local culture, emphasizing the region’s identity. An alternative is Novokholmogory, named after Kholmogory, the city’s former name before 1613, which also highlights historical aspects and local traditions."

The name, associated with religious themes, contradicts the Decembrist spirit striving for secularity and renewal. Thus, there is a need to find a new name reflecting the modern perception and history of the region.\n\nOne proposed option is Primorsk, emphasizing the city’s geographical feature of proximity to the sea and symbolizing openness and cultural diversity. Another option is Sitka, referencing the indigenous traditions and heritage of the Tlingit people. This choice respects the region’s history while bridging past and present, creating a connection between cultures.
