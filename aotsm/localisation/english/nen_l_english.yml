  nen.1.t:0 "British Investigation"
 nen.1.d:0 "        And again, not rosy news visits our country. Today, the Lords from Foggy Albion once again raised the issue that our leader Robert Owen is a man of socialist views. Although Lord Protector Lem himself promised protection to our leader, the House of Lords decided to take a desperate step and announce an investigation without Lem's seal.\n       Such a state of affairs will clearly negatively affect the stability of New England, and it is also likely that this event will become another escalation of the conflict between supporters of the metropolis and those who desire independence from it.\n      Of all the options we have, it is only that we are obliged to assist the investigation in everything. And if they find anything they do not like, then we may have to say goodbye to Robert Owen. Although in the last ten years he has given himself entirely to our country, apparently in the Confederation there is growing fear of the Chartists, which forces them to look for enemies even among the loyalists of London."
 nen.1.a:0 "Let's hope everything will be fine..."

 nen.2.t:0 "Investigation Results"
 nen.2.d:0 "        The investigation conducted in New England has come to an end. The outcome did not surprise any of the Lords: Robert Owen was found guilty of sympathy for the Chartists, aiding their terrorist activities, as well as accepting bribes from other socialist movements in Europe. These accusations give us free hands in resolving the leadership problem in New England.\n      As soon as Lem was handed the investigation results, he was saddened. That in his, what he thought was a democratic and free country, persecution of the innocent begins. Although he does not hide his concerns about the Chartists, Lem was sure that Owen had no relation to them.\n     Now a delegation has been sent to New England to arrest Robert and establish temporary administration there, during which time the House of Lords must choose a new Lord of Cromwell. Now many who decided the fate of New England have only one name on their lips: Frederick William Robert Stewart."
 nen.2.a:0 "As expected"

 nen.3.t:0 "Direct Rule from London"
 nen.3.d:0 "        The delegation arrived from the British Isles Confederation almost immediately arrested Robert Owen and placed a council of London officials in his place. This arrangement immediately affected the situation inside New England; now those forces striving for independence are strengthening by all available means, and those who wish to continue moving with the metropolis speak of it less and less.\n     With its decision, the House of Lords finally broke the chances for peaceful resolution of the independence issue. Due to Owen's popularity throughout the country, farewell events to their beloved Lord are beginning. Still, every inhabitant of New England knew that no one would return him.\n     Dark clouds are gathering over the future relations of the Cromwell autonomy and the metropolis..."
 nen.3.a:0 "The match is getting closer to the powder keg..."

 nen.4.t:0 "Next Leader of New England"
 nen.4.d:0 "        And the day of voting for the new leader of New England has come. There are only three options in the list of possible leaders:\n\n        George Gordon Byron - a poet and one of Lem's loyal supporters. Such a person was proposed by the Lord Protector himself, referring to the fact that his wife claims Byron will be a loyal mayor of London and will ensure peaceful coexistence with our colony. However, many Lords have doubts that the writer who conquered Europe in the late 10s and early 20s can surprise the inhabitants of Cromwell.\n\n        Robert Edward Lee - a military man who commands the defense forces of New England. A stable option according to many Lords. Because working with the military is very simple due to the introduction of many bureaucratic apparatuses inside the armed forces. This allows easier control and much easier maintenance of loyalty.\n\n     Frederick William Robert Stewart - the favorite of the Lords. He is a representative of London's elites, as well as one of the members of the Cromwell party, which will allow direct rule of New England through him. However, there are concerns that John Russell and Robert Peel will have greater influence on him.\n\n     All three candidates have both their minuses and pluses, which is why a quick decision was not made. But after several votes, the result was a victory..."
 nen.4.a:0 "...of George Gordon Byron!"
 nen.4.b:0 "...of Robert Edward Lee!"
 nen.4.c:0 "...of Frederick William Robert Stewart!"
 
  nen.41.t:0 "Poet Rulers"
 nen.41.d:0 "       Today our new Lord arrived in the autonomy; it was George Gordon Byron. On one hand, many residents do not even know who he is, but on the other hand, in New England Byron is known for his love of Greek culture, as well as a love affair with Ulm Lem's wife.\n        Such a choice can be seen as an insult to the residents of New England. And the fact that the British Isles Confederation thinks that by putting a weak leader in place they can control us? That will be their fatal mistake."
 nen.41.a:0 "Couldn't they find anyone better?"

 nen.42.t:0 "Military at the Top"
 nen.42.d:0 "       Today many residents of Cromwell expected a ship with the new Lord of New England, but instead of the expected leader, a London delegation arrived with a letter stating: the next leader of New England is Robert Edward Lee.\n        Few expected such a decision, but now many residents of New England have hope for tomorrow. After all, Robert cannot be a patriot of the Confederation, where he has never been, which means he serves the residents of New England, inspiring hope in those who want to believe he can throw off the chains of British rule."
 nen.42.a:0 "They give us hope..."

 nen.43.t:0 "London's Servant"
 nen.43.d:0 "       Tension hung in the air from early morning; of course, many referred to the fact that today the new Lord of New England was supposed to arrive, but many were sure this was only the beginning...\n      To the surprise of many, the new ruler did not hurry to them and arrived only in the evening. The first thing he did was spit on our land, followed by an order to disperse those who met him.\n     Such behavior speaks of only one thing: he is an agent of London. And thus the enemy of our freedom... We have no choice but to prepare to remove him as soon as possible!"
 nen.43.a:0 "Damn the Confederation!"

 nen.5.t:0 "Elections of [nen_election_year]"
 nen.5.d:0 "[nen_election_text]"
 nen.5.a:0 "And again the horse of democracy triumphs"
 nen.5.b:0 "The white horse snatched victory"
 nen.5.c:0 "The dark horse surged ahead"
