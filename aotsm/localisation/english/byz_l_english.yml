 BYZ_admit_japan_naval_power_desc:0 "Advisors and diplomats who arrived in Japan reported an intimidating number of the newest ships possessed by this island state.

But almost everyone could say that unlike his father, he strives to learn. However, tragedy left a mark on Zacharias; he became much more serious than before, which allowed him to become the best student again. After a grand ceremony in 1855, he was crowned as the new emperor of the Roman Empire and Emperor of the Eastern lands. Now only Zacharias will choose the empire's direction."

Zacharias was glad to have a brother. However, since Constantin was not the heir prince, his education was overlooked, resulting in less success compared to his brother. While their father was alive, Zacharias spent almost all his time on his brother.\nLife became difficult for Constantin at age 2 when his father Michael XIII died and Zacharias ascended the throne. The new emperor continued to communicate with his brother, but due to many affairs, could not devote enough time to him.\nAt 12, Constantin was sent to the Constantinople Academy to study diplomatic skills. However, his studies went poorly as he was uninterested. By 14, he could have easily dropped out, but his brother's intervention allowed him to continue. Constantin saw this as freedom to do as he pleased. Unfortunately, he neglected important matters and became a burden to his brother.\nEverything changed in 1842 when Zacharias V died, and August did not plan to support Constantin's idle lifestyle. Constantin had to enter politics to retain some power but was quickly recruited by the democratic faction of the senate. After that, Constantin became the prince of the democrats, seen as the end of imperial power."

Initially, the Metaksis family had no plans for Ekaterina, but when the opportunity to marry her to the future emperor appeared, they immediately began preparations.\nFrom childhood, Ekaterina saw that decisions were made for her. Such upbringing should have made her obedient, but it had the opposite effect. By age 8, she began using her aristocratic roots to give orders to servants, but unlike the rest of her family, she was surprisingly restrained.\nBy 16, she was introduced to the future emperor August. Their relationship was difficult from the start, as both were quite free-spirited. At 17, she was forced to marry August. Initially, this annoyed her, but once she realized the doors it opened, she began planning her future.\nAfter becoming empress, she promoted women's rights but was moderate. Her main desire was to reduce the gap between men's and women's rights. By 1849, her relationship with August had normalized, and they could call their marriage happy.

 POLITICS_JULIUS_ROMANUS_DESC:0 "Full name: Julius Romanus.\nDate of birth: September 1, 1786.\nPlace of birth: Gallipoli.\nPosition: Head of the Imperial Guard, Regent of the Romean Empire.\nJulius was raised under Roman traditions even at the end of the 18th century. From birth, he was brought up in harsh conditions. His childhood was extremely tough, with parents creating many trials to make him strong and resilient. This upbringing made him very independent and cold.\nAt 11, he moved with his family to Constantinople and was enrolled in a military academy. After that, he saw his family only a few times. The academy's teaching methods were outdated, noticed by many but rarely criticized. Julius was different; he constantly argued about how education should proceed. This caught the attention of the former head of the Imperial Guard, Flavius, who took Julius as an apprentice at 16.\nThanks to his character, the approach to officer training changed first in Constantinople's academy and then in others across Romea. Many believe that if Julius had been born ten years earlier, the disgrace of 1806 could have been avoided.\nAfter the Coalition Wars, Julius adopted many tactics, from Napoleon's initial strategies to Prussia's tactics at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt. By 1822, he became head of the guard and reformed it into more than just a ceremonial unit. By 1830, the guard was a small army ready to defend the empire and was called to participate in the Mesopotamian War later that year."

 byz.1.t:0 "Troop Entry into Dobrudja"
 byz.1.d:0 "As soon as we broke the backbone of the Bulgarian-Wallachian kingdom, we immediately decided not to stop on Bulgarian lands. We needed more, and that more became Dobrudja.\nNow our valiant soldiers have already succeeded in destroying enemy garrisons on these lands. Seeing how easily our army was able to march again on enemy territory inspired hope that we could quickly reclaim lost lands.\nTalks about where to go next now do not cease. But the answer is obvious: after the Bulgarian-Wallachian barbarians will come the Albanians or Serbs."
 byz.1.a:0 "The ground trembles under the feet of the legions"

 byz.2.t:0 "Restore Religious Values in the Balkans"
 byz.2.d:0 "Over time, they drifted away from us, both towards Catholicism and Orthodoxy. It's time to end this and show them that there can only be one faith."
 byz.2.a:0 "Ave Maria!"

 byz.3.t:0 "Dalmatia"
 byz.3.d:0 "In the times of our rule, Bosnia did not exist, there was only united Dalmatia, so let this name return and be eternal."
 byz.3.a:0 "Bosnia no longer exists."

 byz.4.t:0 "Restoration of the Balkan Border"
 byz.4.d:0 "Victory over Austria gave us lost territories, which allowed us to approach Rome."
 byz.4.a:0 "All roads lead to Rome"

 byz.5.t:0 "Purchase of Gibraltar"
 byz.5.d:0 "The Romeans want to buy Gibraltar — the rock that allows them to control the exit from the Mediterranean on par with us. Losing such an important object will clearly be unpleasant, but the threat of war from their side could put an end to our history."
 byz.5.a:0 "Will they ask for more?"
 byz.5.b:0 "Our lands are not for sale"

 byz.6.t:0 "Purchase of Ceuta"
 byz.6.d:0 "The Romeans want to buy the city of Ceuta, which controls the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea. Losing this city will cost us dearly, but it seems we have no right to refuse now, as the consequences would be catastrophic."
 byz.6.a:0 "Only the city and not an inch more"
 byz.6.b:0 "Even if British, our lands are not for sale"

 byz.7.t:0 "Prussia Calls Us to War"
 byz.7.d:0 "Our friends from Germany have once again decided to attack Austria. This time, according to them, it is the final battle, so considering our territorial claims, they decided to invite us.\nOf course, we can refuse, but then we might miss the chance to easily gain lands. We know of Austria's weakness, and the two previous wars showed that Prussia manages well without us. So it is obvious that this invitation is just a formal pretext to offer us lands in exchange for further cooperation."

 byz.9.d:0 "The discussion has been ongoing for several days, caused by the coalition of the Trade and People's factions (Coalition of Democratic Forces), which decided to bring up the question of the emperor's power in the state. They, naturally, advocate for his removal from power and transition to a republic while keeping the titular empire. The Imperial faction, in turn, strongly opposes this idea. The General faction remained neutral until today's session, where restrictions on the emperor were supplemented by restrictions on military power, causing the latter to join the coalition with the Imperial faction. The majority of the senate still supports the coalition of democratic forces, but with a gap of only 5 seats, the floor is given to His Imperial Majesty, and he decides..."
 byz.9.a:0 "... to stand and deliver a speech."
 byz.9.b:0 "... to accept his fate."

 byz.10.t:0 "Proposal from Romea"
 byz.10.d:0 "The Romeans want to increase their influence in one of our regions in exchange for guarantees."
 byz.10.a:0 "Great Deal"
 byz.10.b:0 "We Are Strong Alone"

 byz.11.t:0 "Speech"
 byz.11.d:0 "The emperor slowly rose to the podium and removed the imperial crown. \n\n —\"Honorable senate, I am a citizen of our great country just like each one of you here. And you demand that I relinquish power in such tense times? My father told me how our country suffered during the 'War of the Third Coalition,' how our soldiers died for our ideals, for our future. And now, when tension in Europe grows stronger every day, you want me to simply leave, turning away from my people?\" — said the emperor. \n\n —\"We only demand freedom and justice for all. We are a European country and must develop like everyone else.\" — retorted the head of the People's faction, Alexandros Mavrokordatos. However, the emperor continued his speech, ignoring Alexandros's comments. \n\n —\"But do not hard times require a strong hand to lead the people to victory? Today I speak not as your emperor, but as your compatriot. I want our empire to succeed, not fall as it once could have. If the Great Zacharias had been weak, could he have defeated the Ottomans at Gallipoli? No. And you speak of freedom and justice? Look at Russia, has anything changed there with the monarch's departure? Not at all, life becomes harder every year. And France, which proudly overthrew its monarch, starting a bloody carnage in Europe, is that the freedom and justice you desire? I think not.\" — by the end, the emperor spoke with clear pride and sorrow. \n\n —\"But if we allow your tyranny to happen, will anyone be well? Will not decades of pain, hunger, and wars begin?\" — interrupted the emperor, Alexandros. \n\n —\"I swear to every citizen of our state, I will never be a tyrant! I will become someone our people will be proud of. I swear that our empire will again achieve the successes of Justinian I. I pledge that by 1854 I will begin implementing the first reforms that will allow, as you say, 'to give freedom' to the citizens.\" — In the senate, as they say, a minute of silence hung, during which the emperor placed the crown back on his head and took his seat. \n\n The Imperial and General factions gave applause, which was no surprise, but strangely, even some members of the People's and Trade factions began applauding. This led to..."
 byz.11.a:0 "... the majority now being with us!"

 byz.12.t:0 "Unaccepted Challenge"
 byz.12.d:0 "His Imperial Majesty August II decided not to tempt fate and to make concessions to the senate. This decision will clearly have consequences and likely very severe ones, as the senate lost the loyalty of two factions, causing a split that will be a severe test for the empire."
 byz.12.a:0 "Reformists rejoice, imperialists weep!"

 byz.13.t:0 "The Future of the Italian Peninsula"
 byz.13.d:0 "Italy is again in the hands of the Empire. But the government has no unified position regarding these lands: some propose to annex all of Italy immediately, others suggest taking Rome as a symbol of our power, and a third group proposes not to touch them yet to allow slow integration into our society. The first option will clearly be poorly received by the Italian people, the second is neutral, and the third will please them. But as with any decision, the final say rests with the Emperor."
 byz.13.a:0 "We don't need the Italian Peninsula, we need its lands, so annex them"
 byz.13.b:0 "Take Rome, let the rest integrate slowly"
 byz.13.c:0 "Better to slowly integrate them into the empire"

 byz.14.t:0 "New Capital?"
 byz.14.d:0 "Rome is again part of the Empire; it's time to decide whether to make it the capital. On one hand, the opinion is that the Roman Empire cannot be called Roman without a capital in Rome; on the other hand, Constantine the Great moved the capital to Constantinople, so the city can be a legitimate capital. The old elites ask to keep the capital, but young politicians crave a new one."
 byz.14.a:0 "Rome — the true capital of the Roman Empire!"
 byz.14.b:0 "Constantinople — the true capital of the Roman Empire!"
 byz.14.c:0 "We have a more interesting option..."

 byz.15.t:0 "Letter from Zergius"
 byz.15.d:0 "       Your August Majesty, you have received a letter from your nephew, Duke Zergius Zachareas. He asks you to keep Armenian generals and officers from the Caucasian provincial army in the service of the state within the main Romean army, as they are forced to retire honorably due to the dissolution of the autonomous imperial province of the Caucasus. Duke Zergius fully understands that our army already has too many officers, but he emphasizes in his letter to you that our general staff also needs competent people who understand how to conduct combat in mountainous and foothill terrain."
 byz.15.a:0 "We will gladly accept them into our army"
 byz.15.b:0 "We do not need them"

 byz.16.t:0 "Loyal Turks"
 byz.16.d:0 "My emperor, allow me to congratulate you on the abolition of the Anatolian autonomous province and the beginning of the long-awaited centralization process. The Romean Empire is now stronger than ever, and we will finally be able to easily deal with our rivals! But forgive me for overshadowing such a good event, the Turkish officers are a problem that needs to be solved by you at the moment, my emperor. We cannot allow these infidels to remain unpunished; a conspiracy against you has long been brewing in the heart of Anatolia," said Senator and President of Hellas Ioannis Kapodistrias at the Senate session on the former Anatolian province.\n"In the lands I govern, Turks will live peacefully and practice their religion and speak their language freely," said August II gloomily.\n"Forgive my boldness, lord, but in the future, this may lead to terrible consequences. Turks and other Muslims will continue to destabilize the country, and this may destroy Romea. The integrity of the empire will be at risk," replied the senator to the emperor.\n"Servants, bring boxes of flowers to the hall," the emperor ordered the nearby servants.\n       A few minutes later, the servants brought a table with the most wonderful flowers growing throughout the country into the senate hall.\n       The emperor asked the senator, "What do you say about these flowers, Ioannis?"\n"The riot of colors is striking, lord," Kapodistrias replied.\n"You may take away all but the yellow ones," "And now?" the emperor asked another question.\n"Worse, lord," the senator answered awkwardly.\n"God loves diversity, Ioannis. Otherwise, He would have created only one kind of flower, one kind of bird, and identical people. But look around, we are all very different. This table was beautiful because it had the most diverse flowers. In the lands I govern, regardless of language and faith; Christians, Jews, and of course Muslims must live peacefully and happily like these flowers. The world is diverse — it is a great gift from the Lord. Turkish officers and soldiers, despite the abolition of Anatolia, must continue to serve in the Romean army, but as emperor, I cannot allow the Young Turks to commit their atrocities against my subjects, and therefore the Ministry of Secret Affairs will deal with the Young Turk cells, which will catch and destroy the Young Turks inside the country and beyond its borders.\n        The emperor left the senate building proudly, senators applauded him standing, and Kapodistrias recalled today's lesson taught by the emperor for a long time."
 byz.16.a:0 "The highest will is the law!"
 byz.16.b:0 "Better to disband them..."

 byz.17.t:0 "Invasion of Austria"
 byz.17.d:0 "       It has begun... Our military advisors have long predicted this war, but now Germany has finally decided to finish Austria. And we need to decide what to do with this: on the one hand, we can wait to see how it ends and then decide the fate of the Balkans with the winner, or we can follow Germany's example and simply invade Austria.\n       The first option is risky because if Germany wins, it might not want to satisfy our territorial claims, even though relations between us are friendly.\n     But invasion always entails one thing... Innocent blood on both sides. Therefore, such an act will hardly be approved by many."
 byz.17.a:0 "The Balkans will be ours!"
 byz.17.b:0 "Better to wait for the outcome of this conflict..."

 byz.18.t:0 "Birth of a Daughter"
 byz.18.d:0 "     In the last couple of weeks, August was waiting for news about the condition of his wife Ekaterina; doctors said last month that her delivery could happen any week. When more than five weeks passed, he began to worry, but this day changed everything...\n     The emperor was listening to senators' petitions about improving various regions of the empire when one of the workers from their family hospital approached August.\n— "My Emperor, I have urgent news for you!" — began the visitor.\n     The emperor gestured to the servants and senators to leave them alone, and as soon as the extra ears left the room, August said: — "And what news do you have?"\n— "Your Excellency, you have given birth to a daughter," the hospital worker joyfully reported. — "Also, I was asked to convey that your wife Ekaterina wishes to name the daughter Zoe."\n— "I was afraid this day would never come," August said with a smile. — "I thought I would never see Ekaterina again, but here is such wonderful news."\n— "Forgive my boldness, but..." — the interlocutor spoke cautiously. — "If I were you, I would hurry to my wife as a loving husband and father."\n— "Indeed... In such a situation, state affairs will wait. Especially forgiving those damn senators," the emperor glanced at his interlocutor. — "You say she wants to name her Zoe? I like it.""
 byz.18.a:0 "Zoe is a beautiful name"

 byz.19.t:0 "Opening of the Parthian Consulate"
 byz.19.d:0 "     Although Parthia is more of a buffer state for us, needed to stabilize the land Silk Road. As much as we want, we cannot forget about interaction with it, so the decision to build a consulate was made quite some time ago. And now we finally have a reason to open it and start an official diplomatic mission with Parthia.\n     Of course, opening such a building imposes certain obligations on us, but there is no need to worry too much about this since during the civil war, so much aid was sent that Parthia will be paying off its debts for centuries. But even with this in mind, we will have to play diplomacy, and pulling them into our alliance may help us on the southern borders of the Empire."
 byz.19.a:0 "This will definitely help our relations"

 byz.20.t:0 "Colonial Question of Zimbabwe"
 byz.20.d:0 "The Romeans want us to become their colonial pawn, like our neighbors the Zulus, but they propose to do this peacefully and ensure our integration into their society."
 byz.20.a:0 "Better them than the French or British"
 byz.20.b:0 "Better the French or British than them"

 byz.50.t:0 "Taurida Dream"
 byz.50.d:0 "       Today, debates did not subside at the general staff about the return of our territories. The main question today was about the territories occupied by Russia. Unsurprisingly, such a region was found, namely Taurida (Crimea).\n\n     Now our military command has begun developing a plan to capture this region with as little resource expenditure as possible. According to the initial concept, there should be 2 landings in the Sevastopol area under the command of one of the generals who have proven or will prove themselves in recent years."
 byz.50.a:0 "Let's wish them good luck"

 byz.51.t:0 "First Meeting with Generals"
 byz.51.d:0 "       The start of military exercises gave impetus to reforms of the general staff. Today it will be decided what direction the military command will take in the coming years.\n        At the moment, there are those in military circles who are supporters of the old school of military actions, as well as those inspired by the speeches of our Prussian friends. On one hand, reliance on traditions has protected our way of life all these years, but on the other hand, our disgrace in 1806 proved the weakness of our military doctrine.\n        Bright representatives of the new school advocate radical army reforms. So that our troops can adequately interact with military equipment, also a rejection of defensive tactics and a transition to the trendy German 'blitz.'\n      But the old generals, whose usefulness has been proven over the years, ask us not to destroy what their grandfathers built. They do not deny the need for army reforms but advocate for creating a doctrine of 'stoicism,' which should be based on discipline and the soldier's unyieldingness in battle."
 byz.51.a:0 "No need to radically change what already works"
 byz.51.b:0 "Enough relying on ancestors, we will defend the homeland, not they"

 byz.52.t:0 "Second Meeting with Generals"
 byz.52.d:0 "       The decision to hold large-scale military exercises brought a lot of benefits:\nFirstly, it initiated reforms in the army.\nSecondly, critical weaknesses of the army doctrine were found.\nThirdly, shifts began in the general staff.\nFourthly, we were able to assert our strength to the whole world again.\n\n       Such a state of affairs cannot but please, but we must not rejoice too much in such a fleeting success. We need to seize the opportunity to reform the armies and continue this process. Alas, this time we face a choice between the advice of the new generation or the advice of the old military.\n        The new generation continues to assert that we urgently need to reform the armed forces before our neighbors do. But this time their statements were more formulated and had at least some arguments. First, they want every soldier to be familiarized with the equipment, both ours and that of our neighbors. Then to start training specialists who will service this equipment and operate it. According to them, with this approach, we can catch up with our neighbors in terms of armed forces development.\n     But the old guard remained true to their convictions this time as well. They continue to argue that we should not change anything abruptly and must gradually prepare new personnel. They also expressed a desire to teach soldiers to dig trenches so that a soldier could hide almost in the open field."
 byz.52.a:0 "A trench sounds very tempting"
 byz.52.b:0 "Let's give free rein to new blood"

 byz.53.t:0 "Third Meeting with Generals"
 byz.53.d:0 "       The stage of army reforms has come to an end. Now our army can compete with most European ones, which washes away the disgrace of 1806.\n       But we must not relax because disagreements in the general staff are growing stronger, so it's time to determine who will be its foundation. We have a choice between supporters of the new military movement and those who continue to cling to traditions. Many of our experts believe this conflict was caused by a generational gap between junior and senior officer ranks.\n     Young fighters ask for a fairer system of staff management, where not only experience but also reaction speed and adaptability to the situation will matter. Many officers of the new school are talented, which will allow us to quickly adapt to the situation at the front.\n      In contrast to the young, we have the old fighters. Those officers who knew those who went to Europe back in 1806. On their side is the experience of many minor conflicts, but also knowledge of the empire's bureaucracy, almost better than the military charter. But they have no more significant successes; maybe it's time to give way to the young?"
 byz.53.a:0 "Let the young listen to the elders"
 byz.53.b:0 "Adaptability will clearly help us"

 byz.54.t:0 "Farewell Letter of Anfim IV"
 byz.54.d:0 "       After the last meeting of the patriarchs, our Ecumenical Patriarch Anfim IV decided to resign and leave the post to go to his homeland to spend his old age. After holding a meeting and then a vote, it was decided to allow him to leave the post with the approval of the majority of the patriarchs.\n       Such a situation has happened more than once, so elections for the Ecumenical Patriarch were held the same day. As a result, Herman IV was elected. Many knew him as a person striving to strengthen relations between Christian confessions, as well as supporting the policy of accepting other confessions and religions within the Empire."
 byz.54.a:0 "May he go in peace"

 byz.55.t:0 "Death of the Patriarch"
 byz.55.d:0 "       No one could have expected that our Ecumenical Patriarch Herman IV would suddenly die, but apparently it was His will. Such an event was too unexpected, which required an urgent meeting of the majority of patriarchs to vote for a new Ecumenical Patriarch.\n       After the Patriarchs of Constantinople, Hellas, and Anatolia gathered, they decided to hold the election of the Ecumenical Patriarch without the other members of the assembly. After several hours of discussion, the choice fell on Anfim VI, who was patriarch before Anfim IV."
 byz.55.a:0 "Rest in peace, our Patriarch"

 byz.56.t:0 "Anfim VI Was Deposed"
 byz.56.d:0 "       Every year brings more trials, and the decision of the patriarchs' assembly was to depose Anfim VI in favor of the more characteristic Kirill VII. Although this decision was met negatively, it was final. Anfim VI himself stated that he supports this decision due to recent events, as he is not sure he can remain a beacon of faith.\n       Few could have thought that the Ecumenical Patriarch could be so easily deposed, but recent years have indeed brought many trials. Many lean towards the idea that this is one of them. The main question now is whether Kirill VII will be able to handle the weight of these years as well as Anfim VI did?"
 byz.56.a:0 "We need a decisive Patriarch now"

 byz.57.t:0 "Romea Began Taurida Exercises"
 byz.57.d:0 "       Troubling news comes from the Black Sea. For about three days, the Romean fleet has been conducting maneuvers they call the 'Taurida Exercises.' At first, it seemed that these were just exercises, but today our reconnaissance vessels began noticing that Romean ships increasingly violate neutral waters.\n\n        Also, one cannot ignore the activity of enemy units in the Caucasus, where Romea has begun concentrating huge forces. There are already rumors about the delivery of the first German 'Panzers' on the main roads between Russia and Romea.\n\n     It can no longer be denied that Romea plans to start a war with us under the cover of these exercises. We urgently need to start preparing for the conflict, or we will lose all initiative, and the outcome will not be in our favor!"
 byz.57.a:0 "Time to switch to high alert"

 byz.58.d:0 "       Today in Zachareaspolis, at the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Cathedral, a grand wedding ceremony took place between Romean prince Zergius Zachareas and Kristina Loris-Melikyan, daughter of the governor of Georgia and hero of the Mesopotamian War, Mikhail Loris-Melikyan.\n       Representatives of the entire aristocracy of the Romean Empire gathered in Zachareaspolis for this solemn event, led by the Romean imperial family Zachareas; even the outcast Konstantin Zachareas was invited to the wedding.\n       Prince Zergius spared no expense on treats and gifts for the common people, and these days in Zachareaspolis were declared a non-working week, with festivities and folk celebrations throughout the city. The wedding of the Duke of Great Armenia and Cyprus was celebrated not only by Christian Hellenes and Armenians but also by the rural Turkic population in the vicinity of Zachareaspolis.\n       The wedding ceremony followed the canons of the Romean Orthodox Church, and by the imperial family's demand, the bride Kristina Loris-Melikyan had to accept Romean Christianity before the marriage.\n       Before the blessing, two gray doves were released into the church, which perched on the cornice above the heads of the newlyweds and remained there throughout the ceremony. Kristina's brother, Tariel Loris-Melikyan, held the wreath over her, and General Petros Bagratuni over the prince.\n       Although many Hellenic aristocrats believe that this marriage was concluded exclusively for the benefit of the Loris-Melikyan house and the Armenian nobility of the Romean Empire, since until this moment, members of the imperial family never married girls from aristocratic families of the imperial province of the Caucasus, which caused great surprise among the Hellenic aristocracy.\n       But those present at the wedding saw that Kristina Loris-Melikyan and Prince Zergius Zachareas married for love."

The Imperial Guard is an elite unit of the Romean army; candidates for service are selected through the strictest selection.\n       The functions of the Imperial Guard are extensive: besides protecting the head of state and his family, it directly commands the internal and external intelligence services of the Romean Empire, all army gendarmerie and police except the gendarme regiments of the Romean Guard — an elite military unit of the Romean army directly subordinated to the emperor, created on a pan-European model, performing combat parades built in the Prussian manner. The Romean Guard proved its full effectiveness and loyalty during the Mesopotamian War. Between these two organizations, there is a secret struggle for power and the emperor's patronage, and by creating them on such a principle, Emperor Zacharias V destroyed any attempts of power seizure by one of these elite organizations, making his power inviolable to the highest military command of the army."

But many doctors lean towards the fact that most likely the emperor will not pull through.\n     Few could have predicted such an outcome, but we have no time for despair. Therefore, preparations began for the possible future coronation of the emperor's son. Also, all those who could be appointed regent in the most extreme case were invited to Constantinople."

Now all the burdens of rule will fall on his son, but the regency council will have to help him in these difficult times.\n        The emperor's death is a severe blow to the Empire, as now even fewer minorities within the empire believe in the legitimacy of the government, and support abroad is also rapidly declining. Such a situation may lead to the Romean Empire once again being on the brink of collapse. Few could have thought that August II was such an important figure for the survival of the state."

Many of these people stayed awake at night to continue the fight for the Emperor's life, and it bore fruit.\n        Many were surprised by one of August's first questions. He was interested if anyone else was hurt during the assassination attempt. That is what a truly people's emperor means. In the end, it was decided that when the emperor can move calmly on his own, he will visit the family of Konstantin Tyuchev to convey personal condolences and monetary compensation."

 byz.63.t:0 "Appointment of the Regent"
 byz.63.d:0 "       It is obvious to everyone that Zacharias cannot rule until coming of age, so the senate vote on appointing a regent took place without the young emperor's consent. The senate justifies this decision by saying the country needs a leader until Zacharias grows up.\n       First, the senate decided who could be a candidate for regency. In a short time, three possible candidates were chosen: Ekaterina Metaxis, wife of August II; Konstantin Zachareas, the closest heir to the throne; Julius Romanus, leader of the Imperial Guard.\n       Konstantin is currently the heir to the empire, so appointing him regent sounds like a logical decision. But many consider him a weak politician since he often agrees with senate decisions and almost never tries to challenge them.\n        Ekaterina is a very strong-willed woman, clearly ready to continue the path her husband built all these years. It is also known that she almost always tries to start a discussion on every senate decision.\n        Julius Romanus is probably the least desired person as regent according to the senate. It is obvious to everyone that he will act not in the interests of the estates and old elites, but in the interests of the state. And of course, even as head of the Imperial Guard, he has several times dissolved the senate during votes on various legislative projects that, in his opinion, contradicted the interests of the Empire."

The Caucasus guard units, lined up in the central square, chanted “Ave Konstantin!”, “Ave Zacharias!”\n      Prince Zergius Zachareas, fearing unnecessary bloodshed, rode a black horse toward the regiments led by the Imperial Guards and began to speak: “This sword, gifted by Prince Zacharias, is inscribed: to my relative and friend Zergius, he is my friend! I ask you, brothers, to come to your senses; for three weeks there has been no supreme power in the country, a conspiracy against the foundations of the state is brewing in Constantinople, a conspiracy aimed at killing the ruling family, and therefore I, ruler of Armenia and Duke of Cyprus Prince Zergius Zachareas, was forced to leave my affairs in the Caucasus and come to Constantinople with the best regiments of the Caucasus corps to prevent the tragedy of our state! Guards, we are servants of the people, and our duty is to serve the country and the people of Romea, so I ask you not to interfere with me; when we finish with the conspirators, I will personally take each of you by the hand and lead you to the young basileus, and he will forgive you!”\n      Soldiers, heeding the duke's words, made way for Zergius’s guards, and he calmly entered the senate.

Who will oppose this action?” At the end of his speech, Prince Zergius also called on the people of Romea to unite around the family of the late emperor in these difficult times for the Romean people.\n       Now that Ekaterina Metaxas has a serious argument in the form of support from one of the influential members of the Zachareas family and a whole army of professional soldiers, no one dares openly challenge her, neither the senate nor the Imperial Guard.\n      Malicious tongues of the foreign press spread dirty rumors about a secret romance between Prince Zergius Zachareas and Ekaterina Metaxas, however, Prince Zergius, who gave an interview to the German press, denies any rumors.\n       Later, Prince Zergius told the press that he will stay with his guard in the capital as long as the Romean Empire is threatened by the danger of a Turkish rebellion; he has no right to stand aside, declared the Romean prince."

Maybe this time Julius Romanus overlooked it, but now there was a senator's seal with a liquidation demand.\n      The Imperial Guard has become, like several emperors ago, something like a secret police that gets rid of enemies of the state. But such a demand, especially regarding a member of the ruling dynasty, could not be accepted quickly, so Julius decided to postpone this issue until the end of the day.\n     All day long, thoughts spun in his head: “Fulfill the will of the senate and become an unnamed hero of the Empire?” or “Be a good friend and once again ignore these senatorial old men.” With such thoughts, the day moved toward night..."

Recently, they lost their eldest son Kyamran, a soldier of the Romean Empire, who died during clashes in Ankara.\n      But all this worried Justinian Felix, commander of the 2nd company of the Vrihedd Brigade, little... approaching the estate, he only said: “There is chaos in the country, and they rejoice. They wait. We will make them shut up; we will destroy these infidels from old men to infants, because if even one Turk survives, he will want revenge.” The estate assistant, coachman Manulyan, seeing the Vrihedd soldiers, immediately understood what was happening and tried to detain the soldiers but was hit on the head with the butt of a Prussian rifle.\n      The soldiers entered the house; the estate was filled with an atmosphere of complete silence and uncertainty. Felix entered the owner's office, where he sat with his wife. Felix stood motionless for several seconds; they only looked at him and waited obediently for what the officer would say, then he drew his saber, cut off the owner's head, and threw it into the hands of his first wife, who loudly sobbed. Meanwhile, the soldiers searched the house for other relatives; they caught a Turk aged 45. The major ordered the soldiers to castrate him. The search continued. One of the Romean soldiers found a 10-year-old boy and stabbed him with a saber. The two brothers of the house owner, instead of resisting the punishers, began to shout that they were going to Cromwland, but the Vrihedd executed them too. When the execution of the men in the estate was over, they gathered their bodies on the street near the main gate and simultaneously drove all the women onto the estate porch. Major Felix ordered not to disturb the owner's first wife and to carry her out sitting in a chair in an unconscious state.\n     Near the road passed a detachment of Romean military gendarmerie; they saw and heard the commotion and rode to the estate. They were already awaited by the Vrihedd soldiers, Lieutenant Colonel of the military gendarmerie Augustin Podolsky, a descendant of Polish emigrants and now an officer of the Romean army. Seeing what the Vrihedd had done, he ordered his men to arrest them, and the Vrihedd to produce their orders. Seeing the inconsistency of Major Felix’s orders, he shouted at him: “By what right do you wear an officer's uniform? Take off the uniform, prisoner Felix.” Felix replied, “I was a major, and now I am a major, and you...” “Do you dare threaten me, prisoner Felix?” he answered, “God forbid, Augustin Voldemarovich, I am only fulfilling the will of our emperor. The emperor appointed me company commander and set the goal to cleanse Anatolia of traitors, and you, Lieutenant Colonel Podolsky, are now preventing me from carrying out the emperor's order.” Podolsky replied;\n“You killed these unfortunate people, I must report this to Constantinople, but for now, you and your men will be under my arrest until the circumstances of what happened are clarified.”"

The regent, interrupting him, said - Will we spare him after they helped the Young Turks kill August II? - The Russians must see how their dictator surrenders and understand the greatness of the Romeans! said the general. - They will accept this reality without him. Attack Rostov at the first stage. - Yes, Regent, said the staff officer. - Continue, Field Marshal - The second stage - our airships will drop bombs on secondary targets, namely Kiev, Kharkiv, Vinnytsia in the west, as well as Stavropol, Astrakhan, Terek in the east. Execution time - 6 hours after the start of the marine landing in Crimea. The third stage - land and sea invasion to the south of Russia for clearing and subsequent occupation of territories. We expect its full capitulation within 4-5 months of war. - What retaliatory measures do we expect, sir Field Marshal? asked the regent. - The strongest resistance of the Russian army will be on the territory of our satellites, replied the field marshal. - Especially in Kuban - there the Russians have built large defensive redoubts and deployed a large land corps, and according to reports from imperial intelligence, they will try to organize offensive actions jointly with local rebel forces. - We assume, sir Regent, that the Russians will resort to suicidal measures. Expect powerful attacks up to Tiflis and Zachareaspolis. - Estimated enemy losses? asked the regent - As a result of bombing attacks, we estimate 15 - 25 thousand deaths, and the land attack will add another 500 - 600 thousand people to this number. - The Russians only have conventional weapons - the casualties will be hundreds of thousands. - And mostly these are residents of the Caucasus, which is an acceptable loss, said one of the generals. - When will you be ready to strike? asked the regent. - By 7 PM tomorrow, regent, replied the field marshal. - Good, tomorrow evening I will read an address to the people of the Romean Empire in the Hagia Sophia Cathedral, and during this speech, the order to attack Russia will be given."

However, appointing a Jewish military advisor will hit the prestige of the traditional Romean nobility, which has long been characterized by antisemitism and xenophobia, causing another surge of discontent among the nobility, but the population of Judea will be inspired by such an appointment. If the Judean government's desire is satisfied, the head of the Jewish Jerusalem bank is ready to allocate free and irrevocable funds to the Romean imperial palace in the amount of 1 million gold Romean Scythats.\nThe second candidate for the position of military advisor at the court is your nephew Zergius Zachareas, your wife Empress Ekaterina insists on returning the relative to the imperial court. However, due to the heavy workload of the prince commanding the Caucasus army, his candidacy for the position of military advisor at the court is unlikely due to the great distance between Zachareaspolis and Constantinople.

In addition to being the first on our path, they are also the most formidable opponent. According to our scouts, the enemy army is about 100 thousand soldiers, which obviously can be a problem. The attack plan itself involves an invasion along the entire front line with priority directions such as Skopje, Burgas, Plovdiv. Depriving the enemy of these border cities will leave them no choice but to surrender. But assessing the risks of such a plan, adjustments were made, namely the addition of a landing in Constanța to sow panic in the enemy's rear.\n         The second target will be Serbia. The country itself is agrarian and weak, which should ensure us an easy invasion, but obviously, after the defeat of their neighbor, they will clearly begin to prepare. Therefore, in addition to the invasion along the entire front line, a landing in Podgorica was added.\n        The third target will be Albania. If everything goes according to the original plan, by the time of the invasion they will be surrounded. Thus, they should become our easiest opponent.\n        The fourth target is Bosnia.

Citizens viewed these changes with mixed emotions: some hoped for the best, others feared for their homeland's fate. No one knew for sure what these changes would bring. Would it be a new bloom of the empire or the beginning of its decline? The question remained open, and only time could give the answer."

 byz.92.d:0 "The Young Turk uprising in Anatolia unleashed violence and disorder. The situation in the Mush region of Western Armenia still amazes ordinary residents of Constantinople. A huge gang of 6,000 Young Turk rebels, led by the insurgents Ferik Pasha, Enver Pasha, and Ali Pasha, attempted to capture and rob the Monastery of the Holy Apostles. The Christian shrine was defended by a detachment of Toros Ozanyan consisting of 40 Armenian militia fighters and 8-10 armed young peasant men from nearby villages. Besides them, the monastery housed priests, 60-70 orphans, their teachers, and auxiliary workers, totaling about 80 people. In just three days of continuous attacks, the Turkish camp suffered over 1,200 killed and wounded. On the 19th day, the Young Turk command offered the besieged terms of capitulation and surrender of the monastery, but Toros Ozanyan, hoping for the swift approach of the Romean army, rejected all Turkish proposals. On the 23rd day, the defending Armenians ran out of ammunition and provisions and decided to leave the monastery, taking all orphans and workers out. They passed through the siege and left in small groups into the mountains. Journalist Lev Schiller describes Toros's actions: '...Toros, dressed in the uniform of a Turkish officer... walked around all the besiegers, speaking to them in excellent Turkish and at the same time showing the retreat path to his people.' The events at the Monastery of the Holy Apostles strengthened Toros's authority and made him a legend among Armenians. 'Toros is not a human being, he is a ghost,' said the Turks after he disappeared. The Kurds believed that when Toros Pasha removed his burka at night, many bullets fell out of it."

 byz.93.d:0 "       The General Staff meeting was not supposed to go beyond the usual, but the unexpected visit of Ensign Dionysus Heleas, who brought the generals documents found during the Kiev operation.\n— "Honorable Generals of the Romean army, I present to you documents that recently arrived from territories liberated from our enemies," the ensign said hurriedly.\n— "Ensigns don’t often work as postmen," Lev Makkela said. "And the address is informal, of course, there is a slip-up, but fortunately you brought interesting things. You’re dismissed."\n       After that, Dionysus left the room, and the generals began to study the documents. At first, there was nothing interesting, but then they came across a charred diary.\n       Day 47\n       At lunch, we drank Caucasian wine and discussed the eternal question: how long will the war last? Vlahos, who lived ten years in Novorossiysk as an engineer-auto mechanic, believed that the war against Russia would reach the limit of the possible and would similarly fizzle out against Germany, at the expense of the English and French. I, on the contrary, argued that the intensity of the war suggests the opposite. After all, uncertainty of the outcome is the worst thing one can imagine.\n       The common forecast that the war will last forever is essentially based on a lack of imagination; it is made by people who see no way out.\n       Detail: Russian prisoners whom Vlahos ordered to be selected from all camps for restoration work: drillers, geologists, local worker-engineers of one fighting unit were used at the station as loaders. There were five hundred of them, of whom three hundred and fifty died on the roadsides. When the remaining were returned, another one hundred and twenty died of exhaustion, so only thirty remained. Evening New Year at headquarters. I again saw that pure joy of the holiday became impossible in these years.\n       Day 59\n       So, General Beybutyan told about the monstrous shameful actions of the British expeditionary corps in Russia during the capture of Kiev. The central street of the city was mentioned again, where the British and the Ukro-Russian garrison brought German and Romean prisoners of war and broadcasted. These are rumors, and I record them as such, but surely mass killings in huge numbers take place. I thought about the wife of the glorious Murad-bey — he was so afraid for her.\n       Looking into individual fates and suspecting the scale of atrocities committed in places of extermination, one feels such suffering of people that one’s hands fall. Disgust seizes me then before the uniforms, epaulets, orders, weapons, whose shine I loved so much. The old knighthood died — wars are waged by destruction technologists.\n       I went outside, where stars twinkled and shots flashed like lightning. Eternal pictures: Ursa Major, Orion, Vega, Pleiades, the Milky Way nebula — what are people and our earthly path before this radiance? What are all our transient sufferings? At midnight, amid the noise of the feast, I remembered dear people to me and vividly felt their greeting reaching me."\n\n       From a diary found near Kiev of an unknown soldier..."

The inhabitants of the empire, accustomed to relative peace and calm, found themselves face to face with an unprecedented trial. Never before has history known such large-scale battles spanning entire continents and uniting millions of people in deadly combat.\n       The empire's capital, Constantinople, is filled with rumors and news from the fronts. Every morning brings fresh reports of losses and victories, of soldiers' heroism and destroyed cities. Ordinary people, once busy with their daily affairs, now live in constant tension, awaiting what tomorrow will bring.\n       Experts and analysts, gathered in the halls of the Academy, debate possible outcomes of the war. All agree on one thing: the results of this conflict will inevitably change the course of world history. The world will never be the same, and those who survive this slaughter will see a completely different reality.\n       But despite fears and uncertainty, the people of Romea find strength to unite their ranks. Old grievances are forgotten, disagreements set aside. Now every citizen of the empire feels part of a whole, ready to stand in defense of their common homeland. Determination can be read in people's eyes: they will not allow the enemy to destroy what has been built for centuries.\n       In the streets of cities, rallies and meetings take place where people express their support for the army and government. Women and children work in factories producing ammunition and gear. Men volunteer, eager to contribute to the common cause.\n       Romea, facing the greatest threat in its history, shows its resilience and unity.

Among serious threats, the following stand out:\n\nFrance.\n       Although France did not interfere much in our affairs in the past, first Napoleon wished to change the map of Europe, and then the socialist revolution. All this happened in less than a century, making France a very unreliable partner in the long term. Although their current government observes all agreements, who said it will be so in the future? Therefore, there are fears that France will become our enemy.\n\nRussia\n       After the Decembrists came to power in 1826, there were hopes they would ease tensions, but the policy of Ivan Ivanovich Pushchin put an end to future peaceful coexistence of our states. Now most of Russia's former dynasty is under our care, which may allow us to establish relations in the future. But unfortunately, Russia currently has a government unfriendly to us, so we should expect that they will remain our rivals for a long time.\n\nConfederation of the British Isles\n       Oh Britain, cursed islands. Foggy Albion always attracted, but now corrupt dictators rule there. As soon as the English dared to think about dominance in the ocean, they immediately began interfering in our affairs, seeing us only as competitors and threats to their ambitions. But every year they increasingly forget that we initially tried to resolve this conflict peacefully, and now hopes for friendship between the British Isles and Romea are so faint that only the whisper of revolution in Albion can save the situation."

But they exceeded all expectations, as the report was made within the first month, and it was not just a perfunctory document but a full report. Such promptness shows that the decision to introduce the guard was extremely successful and that the guard quickly integrated into many spheres of our armed forces.\n\nLand Forces\n       According to this report, the state of our land forces can be characterized as very promising. Our worst fears were dispelled, as a multilingual army is definitely a problem, but a clever solution and a competent rank system allow not to mix soldiers speaking different languages in the same units, which allows everyone to hear orders in their native language. Yes, this is an obvious burden on the officer corps, which must know both their native language and Latin or Greek.\n\nNaval Forces\n       Also, to the surprise of many, the report contained data on the naval forces. According to this data, the state of our fleet is assessed as satisfactory. There are problems that need to be solved, but there are also successes. Based on preliminary data, it can be said that our fleet is the strongest but is already beginning to become obsolete, which means funding for naval forces should be increased."

For the state promised to reward all overtime work both with monetary compensation and special privileges.\n       Perhaps the number of those who do not understand why all this is happening is large, but the number of those who realized that this war will not be for some patch of land, but for the survival of the nation is growing. Over the past years, the patriotic spirit has begun to weaken everywhere, but the appearance of such a strong threat to stability and prosperity united not only the Hellenic world of the Empire but also the other half in the form of loyal Muslims."

To the surprise of many Constantinople residents, the usually decorated Senate tribune was today adorned only with the Romean coat of arms, and the entire Senate zone was filled with soldiers of the Imperial Guard. Many expected the Senate head Ioannis Kapodistrias to speak, but instead Julius Romanus came out with his retinue.\n— Dear citizens! I want to address you on behalf of the Empire, the Senate, and the imperial House. Due to the onset of wartime, it was decided to temporarily limit the Senate's power to speed up and facilitate decisions related to the front, Julius began. — I understand that now you see not a simple citizen but a soldier. But I want to say that I am like each of you. After this speech, I will go to the front to defend our great state.\n       He paused briefly to look around and then continued; — Emperor August II in 1849 gave a speech promising not to become a tyrant. And I, as one of the leaders of Romea's military triumvirate, want to promise the same. Do not fear that one of the triumvirate members will go to the front, for since the beginning of our Empire's history, every respectable leader was obliged to defend his people and land alongside all other citizens.\n       Dimitrios Voulgaris, standing to Julius's right, approached the tribune.\n— Dear citizens and inhabitants of the Empire. I am Dimitrios Voulgaris, the second leader of the triumvirate, and I will be responsible for preserving humanity within the Empire while our esteemed Julius Romanus defends us at the fronts, Voulgaris said thoughtfully. — Today, the old world system is being rethought. And it is we who must stand at the forefront of the new era. I will not promise that the years of war will be easy, but this is the history of Romea. Overcoming hard times again and again makes us who we are. Therefore, I believe that just as the Ottomans could not capture us in the 14th century, so our enemies today will not be able to bring us to our knees!\n       Many gathered watched Kirill VII, who stood to Julius's left, waiting to hear what the Ecumenical Patriarch would say, and now it was his turn;\n— May God protect each of us. Dear and esteemed citizens, my colleagues in the triumvirate rightly said that hard times await us. And I will not lie, what happened was inevitable because in recent years we began to forget faith, but know that this is not your personal fault. For the root of anti-religious thoughts lies in modern thinkers and philosophers, but I will not blame anyone, Kirill said, looking into the soul of each gathered. Today Romea officially entered the European war, and now only God's will and the wisdom of our leaders will guide us. Although I am only the leader of the Christian spiritual life of the Empire, I cannot help but notice how our Muslim fellow citizens, instead of trying to fight us, decided to unite with us in one impulse. And this means that the Christian-Muslim split in our Empire is becoming less significant. So rejoice, today trials begin, the outcome of which will be the birth of a new world.

Victory was achieved thanks to the joint efforts of soldiers and the civilian population, and now it was time to restore normal life.\n       People returned home, to their families, to peaceful labor.

By 1872, capture/conquer the entire south of Africa.\n\n2. Continue developing relations in India and by 1872 propose the Marathas to join our trading company.\n\n3.

News from the factories was not encouraging: more and more workers fell ill and could not cope with the workload. The prolonged war exhausted resources, and the economy began to falter.\n       The first warning signs sounded when factories and plants began to underperform production plans. Workers, driven to exhaustion, could no longer maintain previous work rates. Illness and fatigue took their toll, reducing productivity. The economy, long on the brink, began to fall rapidly.\n       Specialists and economists warned: if the war lasts any longer, the consequences for the economy will be catastrophic.

These people were ready to give their lives for the Motherland, but they wanted their sacrifices not to be in vain.\n       Some proposed strict restrictions on holding celebrations and events in the capital to show that all inhabitants of the empire are united in their desire to defeat the enemy.

The complex situation surrounding the Chinese Empire causes concern among Romean strategists. Despite its vast size and rich resources, China faces serious difficulties in managing its territories. The vast expanses and cultural diversity make governing the country extremely challenging, and a weak bureaucracy only exacerbates the problem.\n       One possible way to address this issue is to provide significant bureaucratic assistance from Romea. Such a step could substantially improve China’s administrative structure, making it more efficient and fitting the demands of the time. This would not only strengthen China’s position but also give Romea the opportunity to influence internal processes within the state. Thus, by strengthening the Chinese administration, Romea could expand its political presence in the region and secure additional levers of influence.\n       However, there is also an alternative scenario. Asia is on the brink of a major military conflict, and the likelihood of a clash between China and Japan grows daily. Sending substantial military aid to China could be a preventive measure to avoid a protracted conflict that would inevitably affect the entire regional economy. By supporting China militarily, Romea could protect itself from a possible collapse of trade in the region and maintain the stability necessary to sustain economic growth.\n       Thus, the choice facing Romea is not as straightforward as it seems at first glance. Both options have their pros and cons, and the final decision will depend on the empire’s long-term goals.

This agreement became an important milestone in the development of relations between the two countries, guaranteeing stability and fostering economic activity in the region.\n       The negotiations were conducted in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutually beneficial compromises.

The gathered faced a difficult task: to choose the right strategy that would lead to victory.\n       The agenda included two main proposals:\n- Transition to a full-scale offensive. Supporters of this approach argued that it was necessary to immediately go on the offensive, taking advantage of numerical and equipment superiority. The main idea was to seize the initiative and impose one’s will on the enemy, crushing their defense and forcing capitulation.\n- Deep defense and enemy exhaustion. Opponents of full-scale offensive proposed to retreat into deep defense, focusing on protecting their territories and creating conditions to wear down the enemy. This plan implied minimizing own losses and destroying the enemy’s economic base, which would ultimately lead to their capitulation.\n       The discussion was lively and emotional. Each participant brought arguments based on analysis of the current situation, resources, and capabilities of both sides. Detailed attack plans were developed, key strike directions defined, and resources allocated, as well as plans for transition to defensive tactics, including digging defensive lines and using difficult border terrain as natural defense barriers. Military leaders left the meeting confident in the chosen course. Now there was only one goal — to choose and implement the plan and ultimately achieve victory."

 byz.113.d:0 "       The military council of the Romean Empire gathered again to discuss a strategic plan, but this time the discussion concerned not combat tactics but methods of maintaining morale and the psychological state of soldiers at the front. It was clear that success in war depended not only on the right tactical choice but also on the confidence and motivation of each fighter.\n       Proposals poured in one after another. Someone suggested strengthening propaganda among soldiers to emphasize the importance of their mission and increase patriotism. Others insisted on improving medical care and supply so that soldiers felt cared for by the command. However, the most radical and ambitious was the 'Grand Plan.'\n       The idea was to create conditions as close as possible to home comfort near the front. Military engineers proposed building temporary camps with comfortable living conditions, supplying food and essentials. Cultural events such as concerts and theatrical performances by invited artists from major cities of the Empire were planned. It was also proposed to organize the delivery of letters and parcels from relatives and loved ones to maintain family connections.\n       The main goal of the 'Grand Plan' was to remind soldiers why they fight. The idea was that improving comfort and caring for soldiers’ morale would raise combat spirit and strengthen troop motivation. Soldiers would know they protect not only their homeland but also their families, friends, and compatriots.\n       The military council approved the proposal, and soon work began on implementing the 'Grand Plan.' Camps were built quickly, and support committees organized the supply of food and essentials. Artists and musicians began preparing programs for performances, and postal services intensified efforts to deliver letters and parcels to the front."

 byz.114.d:0 "       The military council of the Romean Empire gathered again to determine the primary objectives in conducting the war. The main task was to identify which enemy to consider the main threat and direct the main forces against it. The council faced three possible opponents: the British Isles Confederation, France, and the Russian State. Each was considered dangerous but for different reasons.\n       The British Isles Confederation possessed a powerful fleet, which posed a serious threat to the naval forces of the Romean Empire. Control over sea routes was a key factor in achieving victory, and the British represented a real danger in this regard.\n       France was considered a lesser threat since its army was relatively small and its economy weakened. However, French colonial possessions were close to the protectorates of the Romean Empire, creating a risk of invasion into the Empire itself.\n       The Russian State caused the greatest concern. Its vast territories and enormous human resources made Russia practically invincible in a prolonged war. Fighting Russia meant facing harsh climatic conditions and endless reserves of manpower."

 byz.115.d:0 "       History repeats itself like an echo of ancient times. Just as Rome faced Carthage in antiquity, so now the Romean Empire faces three great threats: the British Isles Confederation, the Russian State, and the French Republic. As in past centuries, the Empire faces destruction and must once again stand to defend its values and freedom.\n       Like the Romans, the people and military of the Romean Empire possess a firm belief in the inevitability of victory. They remember the lessons of the past when Rome won the Punic Wars despite Carthage’s numerical superiority. They believe that their faith in justice and righteousness will help them win the battle for freedom and independence.\n       The comparison to the Punic Wars highlights the similarity of situations, where a small but strong Empire confronts giants threatening its existence. Like the Romans, the citizens of the Romean Empire are ready to sacrifice everything to protect their land and the heritage of their ancestors.\n       The upcoming battles will likely be hard and bloody, but every citizen believes that fate favors the Empire and it will emerge victorious from this struggle."

 byz.116.d:0 "       Zacharias sat in his room holding a sheet of paper written in neat handwriting. He could not hold back tears reading the lines written by his mother Catherine. Soon he would turn eighteen and was to become the new Emperor. On the eve of this important event, Catherine decided to write a letter to her son.\n       Catherine wrote about how proud she was that Zacharias had grown into such a worthy young man. She emphasized that regardless of the decisions he would make in the future, she would always be by his side, supporting and helping him. The letter was filled with warmth and love that Zacharias had rarely felt lately. Since the regency council led by Catherine began, meetings with her had become rare. The prince felt lonely and sometimes wondered if his mother even remembered him. But this letter reminded him of the love and care that had always existed between them.\n       Zacharias’s heart filled with warmth and gratitude. He realized that despite all the difficulties and trials ahead, he had the support and love of the dearest woman to him — his mother."

There was always tension between them, and the prince considered his relative a representative of the idle aristocracy, concerned only with their own pleasures. Nevertheless, Constantine had been appointed regent, and now that Zacharias was about to turn eighteen, it was time to hand over power to the new emperor.\n       Constantine began the conversation with regret, speaking about how hard it was for him to say goodbye to the regency. His eyes shone with hope when he mentioned that he expected a reward for his services. Although Zacharias despised such motives, he preferred to keep his composure and not express his dissatisfaction aloud.\n— “Dear Zacharias,” said Constantine, “I hope you appreciate my efforts. These years have not been in vain, and I sincerely wish you luck in your future endeavors. I hope you find a way to express your gratitude.”\n       The prince barely restrained sarcasm but answered calmly:\n— “Of course, Constantine. I appreciate your efforts. We will discuss this later.”\n       When Constantine left the room, Zacharias allowed himself to relax. He quietly muttered: — “I will reward you, of course... But it’s unlikely to be what you expect.”"

 byz.118.d:0 "Zacharias and Julius Romanus, head of the imperial guard, were leisurely walking through the palace garden. Julius, being regent, had extensive experience in state governance even before the regency. Therefore, he wanted to share his thoughts with the future emperor.\n — “You know, Zacharias,” began Julius, “when I first took the regent position, I was not sure you could become a good ruler in the future. But the years have shown me that you are growing into a worthy ruler. Your thirst for knowledge and desire to improve the people's lives impress me.”\n       Zacharias listened attentively, feeling warmth spreading through his chest. He always respected Julius for his honesty and straightforwardness.\n— “It is important to remember,” continued Julius, “that every decision you make will have consequences. Be careful and think through your actions thoroughly. Do not repeat the tragedies of the past, especially those that befell your father. The Empire needs a strong and wise leader.”\n       Zacharias nodded, absorbing every word.\n— “You are young, Zacharias,” added Julius, “but you have potential. If you follow your convictions and listen to the advice of experienced people, you will become a good emperor. Maybe not the greatest, but definitely a good one.”\n       These words encouraged Zacharias. He understood that the path to the throne would not be easy, but now he felt he was not alone on this journey."

However, rumors say that the Senate, and even Augustus himself, have already begun searching for a suitable wife for the future emperor.\n      Zacharias himself noted in his speech that this event is not so important, as he has yet to achieve anything significant, and therefore he is not that important. This speech surprised many, as modesty is not usually a trait of future rulers.\n        Augustus’s reign clearly creates good ground for his son and will allow him to continue the golden era of the Romean Empire.

The entire ceremony was rushed, which greatly upset Zacharias himself, who would have liked to postpone it for some time.\n        As soon as the ceremony ended, the new emperor gave a speech focusing on the issues of minorities in the empire and the unstable world situation. He sees the solution to the first problem as a return to the doctrine of internal peace, which will restore full cultural and religious freedoms and stop the process of Romanization. The second problem is more specific, as there is no clear solution yet, but the emperor promised that no matter how difficult it is, the empire will endure.\n     Many observers throughout the evening never saw even a hint of a smile on Zacharias’s face.

Zacharias felt the heavy burden of responsibility settle on his shoulders.\n       His thoughts wandered between past and future. Memories of years of study and forming connections with young politicians surfaced. He knew that his education and contacts would become important tools in governing the empire. But most importantly — Zacharias aspired for his reign to bring benefit to the people and his family.\n       He pondered the first steps he would have to take. Strengthening the economy, improving social policy, maintaining peaceful relations with neighbors — all this required attention and wisdom. Zacharias understood that difficult decisions and hard days lay ahead. But he was ready to take responsibility and prove he deserved to bear the title of emperor."

The ceremony was concise but majestic. Instead of lavish speeches and long prayers, short, clear orders and reports were heard. The imperial crown, topped with the symbol of military valor, was placed on Zacharias’s head.\n       The new emperor’s gaze was firm and confident. He knew what awaited him ahead.

Alexander Nikolaevich began slowly walking to the podium; his gait showed he was clearly nervous, but his eyes reflected confidence in his views. As soon as he stood before the podium, Alexander scanned the crowd and began his speech:\n— Dear brothers and sisters, — he began, — Today the greatest injustice in history is happening — towards both the Romean Empire and my homeland. I have lived in the walls of your beautiful Constantinople for almost 30 years. And I realized that Russia’s policy was mistaken: instead of seeking unnecessary enemies — including your people — we should have, like in the times of Kievan Rus, extended a hand to you, standing together against European barbarians.\nHe looked around the crowd again, exhaled, and continued; — You know, for many years I studied your great libraries and realized — the Decembrists forgot the true meaning of Rus, but you, even not being Russian, remembered every step of ours. But today’s speech is not about the greatness of Constantinople or the weakness of the Decembrists. No, it will be about...\n— How we must unite in the fight against our common enemy. Russia is not an enemy of Romea, just as Romea is not an enemy of Russia. We have all been deceived by the ambitions and thirst for power of my ancestors. Therefore, I want to say one ancient Russian interjection: “Goyda” — meaning a call to immediate action. And here I am, calling every son and daughter of Russia to go into the sacred battle against usurpers, godless people, and moral degenerates called Decembrists. Those who disgrace Russia’s name more than any past ruler, so... Goyda, brothers and sisters, Goyda, fear the world that has lost true beauty, true faith, true wisdom, ruled by madmen and godless people. Let them fear, for Romea and Russia follow them! Goyda!\n      As soon as he finished, the entire square began to drown in applause and cries of “GOYDA” — from both ordinary people of Constantinople and Russian officers gathered here today. Afterward, Alexander quickly left the podium. The next speech was in Latin and was dedicated to inspiring the Romean military.\n      After some time, Julius Romanus met with Alexander Nikolaevich and congratulated him on the wonderful speech, expressing hope in the sincerity of the emperor’s words.

Their goal was to strengthen imperial positions and reclaim lost territories, ensure border security, and restore control over strategically important regions.\n      The first phase planned was an attack on the Bulgarian-Wallachian Kingdom. The objective was to establish full control over the fertile lands of the Danube Plain, providing access to important trade routes and resources.\n      Next, it was planned to capture the Albanian Kingdom, located on the Adriatic coast. Control over these territories would allow control of maritime routes and ensure a reliable rear for further operations.\n      The third phase envisaged an advance on the Kingdom of Serbia. This would consolidate the successes of previous campaigns and establish firm control over the central areas of the Balkan Peninsula.\n      The final stage of the campaign implied the capture of the Bosnian Kingdom. Gaining control over these lands would complete the creation of a continuous zone of imperial influence in the Balkans, ensuring security and stability for many years to come.\n      Thus, the generals insisted on the swift conduct of this campaign, believing it to be the only way to restore prestige and demonstrate the power of the Romean Empire."

However, by maintaining the course, we have already moved away from full slavery.\n\nSenators and the emperor support starting reforms to abolish slavery.

The generals want us to demand a non-aggression pact to avoid future aggression from their side. Franz Joseph, however, proposed the strangest idea.

 byz_warmachines.1.d:0 "     Several months after our victory over the Bulgarian-Wallachian tsar and his 100,000-strong army, our high command conducted a series of inspections of the troops operating in Bulgaria. The analysis of the actions of our regiments and army led to disappointing conclusions. The Bulgarian-Wallachian troops, armed with old rifles and cannons from the anti-French wars, managed to offer brief but fierce resistance to numerous detachments of the 1st and 2nd armies near Burgas and during the capture of Tarnovo.\n     A special mention deserves the analysis of the grand battle near Plevna, where small remnants of the Bulgarian army, covering the retreat of the tsar’s family to Wallachia along with Russian volunteers, using all advantages of hilly and forested terrain, shelled from three directions with 24-mm artillery the supply trains of the 1st army advancing on Plevna from the south. Bulgarian artillery managed to destroy 7 advanced regiments and forced the advancing Romean army to retreat to avoid heavy bombardment.\n     But after heavy fighting, Plevna fell after a few days, and Romean soldiers raised Romean standards in the city center.\n     An important detail in Bulgaria’s defeat is also its territorial disputes with neighboring Serbia, which also claimed the northern part of Macedonia controlled by Bulgaria. During our attack on Bulgaria, Serbian troops attempted to simultaneously capture the capital of northern Macedonia — Skopje — but were repelled by Bulgarians and severely battered.\n     During the attack on Serbia, the recent defeat of the Serbs by Bulgarians and the weakening of the Serbian kingdom’s army as a potential opponent will only play to our troops’ advantage.\n     An important detail requiring the general staff’s attention is the behavior of Anatolian regiments during the Bulgarian campaign. Brigadier General of the Turks, Lufti Pasha, deliberately ordered his troops to shell Christian Bulgarian churches and plunder the peaceful population of Bulgaria; especially notable in this were the 'Bashi-bazouks' — irregular infantry recruited from wild tribes of Turkic peoples of Asia Minor."

Its results were sent to Constantinople for detailed review and decision on the continuation of the Balkan campaign.\n     Albania was supposed to be the weakest opponent, but instead, it became an extremely problematic area for our army. This campaign showed that although our troops are familiar with mountainous terrain, they do not know how to use its advantages and are unprepared for its disadvantages. All battles with the Albanian army were fought near mountains, where the enemy knew every cave, every mountain path, and every nook where a soldier or even artillery could hide.\n     Initially, very few losses were expected, but after the first battles, it became clear that losses were unavoidable. Therefore, the decision to withdraw Greek formations from the rearguard and replace them with Turkish troops helped avoid losing experienced soldiers at the cost of less trained ones. Initially, the headquarters opposed this, but Rashid Mehmed Pasha, as the chief general of the Turkish forces, supported the idea. In his opinion, Turkish soldiers had personal reasons to destroy Albanian soldiers.\n     The outcome of this campaign was our victory over Albania, but the decision to hand over the rearguard to Mehmed Pasha was a reckless one, as the methods of warfare of Islamic Turkish soldiers differed significantly from ours, which could likely lead to an international scandal."

The main report was sent to Constantinople and passed through the Imperial Guard.\n     First of all, the report highlights the successes of the ongoing army reform. Although Serbia was a weaker opponent than Bulgarian-Wallachia, unlike them, they fought for their entire country. Therefore, their army fought to the end and almost completely avoided leaving the battlefield except for tactical maneuvers. But the report is not all good, as despite reforms helping reduce losses, they were still too high for such a conflict.\n     Initially, losses were expected to be up to 5,000 soldiers killed and wounded, but unfortunately, there were more than 12,000 wounded and about 3,500 killed. Such losses are likely related to how fiercely the Serbs defended every meter of their land.\n     The overall conclusion of this analysis is that the newest tactics showed themselves very positively, but the combat experience and spirit of our soldiers are far from the desired level. But now, having precise data on this campaign, we can continue the Balkan campaign."

Simply conduct marches through the streets and search for agitators. Such actions will not cause many deaths but may still increase the radicalism of the 'Young Turks.'\n\nThe third plan is the simplest: use the army only if the situation escalates into open conflict.

This plan will likely reduce the discontent of the fearful but will probably greatly increase the radicalism of both the city rebels and the overall 'Young Turk' movement.\n\nThe second plan is to start searching for agitators to eliminate them. It is no secret that every protest has someone who started it. If we delve into this, we can find and eliminate those behind it, but if the plan fails, we will clearly see a significant rise in radicalization.\n\nThe third plan is to try to understand what the discontented want. Not necessarily using force, but listening first. We can try to understand their demands and if they are reasonable, why not meet them?

This action will clearly reduce radicalization.\n\nSecond – use this dialogue as a way to lure their leaders onto our territory and then eliminate them. This plan is very daring and if it works, we will decapitate them in one move, but if it fails, the uprising will be unavoidable.\n\nThird – start dialogue but focus on their leader and seek compromising material on him.

This decision may seem foolish, but maybe this way they will understand we do not want conflict. Although there is a chance this will be seen as weakness, which would be the last straw.\n\nProbably they took weapons to defend themselves. So if we only eliminate those who attack first, we can show that we only defend ourselves and do not want full-scale conflict.\n\nOr simply stop tolerating this and start storming the city, killing everyone found with weapons. This is likely the most radical decision on our part, but it may put an end to this conflict."

Many agree that reforms are necessary because we must continue to be the center of the civilized world, and for that, we must do everything to maintain this status.\n\nAt the end, only the most radical and those who committed crimes during the uprising will be arrested.

Few could have imagined the situation would escalate so much, but now it is clear: this is no longer mere discontent – it is an open rebellion.\n\nThe generals, watching government forces flee Turkish cities, could not believe their Empire was in such a fragile state. But past victories gave them confidence they could save the Empire in this crisis.\n\n– 'There will be few to conquer...

Romean guards rose on the central parade ground of the regiment wishing to punish their commander, Colonel Christian Speidel, for what they considered excessively harsh corporal punishments on subordinates. Fortunately, Major Venezilos was there and managed to calm the soldiers and bring them before the basileus in the Holy Palace.\n      Prince Sergius insists that the mutinous regiment be disbanded and the officers involved be sent to serve in Mesopotamia without the right to discharge or leave.

The city, specially built to be the second capital of the Roman Empire, became a center of science and culture for humanity. Constantinople was important not only for Romea but also attracted the attention of Western European, Asian, and Russian rulers.\n       Constantinople is divided into three large districts. The historic district — home to the elite of Romean society, also called the Old City: the city limits before the 17th century. The Western city, or Gate of Europe, stretches roughly to the modern Evdoxiopolis district. The Eastern city, or Gate of Asia, extends to Nicomedia.\n        The eastern part of the city hosts most of the industrialization, while the western part has the most prestigious housing for the engineering class. The city is inhabited by nearly all peoples of the world; merchants come from all corners of the planet. Besides Hellenic districts, the largest neighborhoods are Armenian, Turkic, Russian, and German quarters. Constantinople impresses with its local architectural style and developed industrial zone."

 byz_lore.3.d:0 "       Special attention deserves the local Jewish diaspora living in Constantinople. Since the founding of the Romean Empire, Jews primarily engaged in crafts and trade. Legally, Jews faced several restrictions: they were forbidden to own Christian slaves, preach their faith, hold government positions, or attend public ceremonies. They also faced significant everyday restrictions. Accordingly, Jews were not considered reliable subjects of the emperors, but everything changed in 1344 after the accession of the Zachareas dynasty.\n       According to records of that time, Basileus Zacharias I was himself Jewish before his accession and bore the name Zacharias of Thebes, but upon becoming basileus, he converted to Orthodoxy and adopted a Hellenic name and surname. Under him and his descendants, Jews received many concessions within Romea, though they still could not hold government posts, as officials practicing Judaism would have caused a storm of criticism from the Christian elite. After the liberation of Judea by Byzantine troops and crusaders in the 17th century, Romea sponsored and facilitated the return of Jews to their historic homeland, attracting significant investments from them.\n        However, in the early 19th century in Constantinople, despite religious tolerance and respectful treatment of Jews by imperial authorities, due to rising nationalism in certain circles of Romean society, periodic Jewish pogroms erupted."

 byz_lore.4.d:0 "       Starting from the second half of the 18th century, namely after the visit of Frederick the Great, Prussian Germans began settling in Constantinople. The first generation of German immigrants appeared during visits to Constantinople, the capital of the Romean Empire, by Prussian King Frederick the Great.\n     Most of these settlers were craftsmen, industrialists, and military personnel. However, the Prussian subjects who moved here were far from the only Germans inhabiting the capital. In Eastern Constantinople, the Theodoric Goth quarter remained, inhabited by Goths who fled to Romea after the annexation of Crimea by Russian Empress Catherine the Great in 1783.\n       Some of the most beautiful villas on the Bosphorus coast (Krupp Villa, Huber Villa), the German Fountain, and the Emerald Railway Station in Constantinople were built by Germans. Most of those who worked on the construction of the Emerald Station later formed a small German district near the Weser quarter in eastern Constantinople. Earlier, architect August Jachmund designed the Zacharias Station project in western Constantinople, near the German Eastern Bank building in the New Theodosia quarter.\n      Both these stations later played an important role in the Berlin-Constantinople-Babylon railway project, which helped strengthen economic and political ties between the German and Romean empires, promoting trade with the East by extending the railway line further south to the port of Basra on the Persian Gulf."

 byz_lore.5.d:0 "       After the defeat of the Decembrist uprising in 1825 and the abdication of the Russian throne, the Grand Duke of Finland (nominal) Nikolai Pavlovich Romanov, on the advice of Prince Vyazemsky, requested political asylum from the Emperor of the Romean Empire, Zacharias V Zachareas. Understanding the terrible circumstances of the Russian imperial family, the basileus allowed the House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov to settle in Constantinople.\n       Upon arrival, Nikolai Pavlovich came with his mother Maria Feodorovna, his wife Alexandra Feodorovna of the Hohenzollern dynasty, and children Alexander, Maria, and Olga. During their exile in Constantinople, more children were born: Alexandra, Konstantin, Nikolai, and Mikhail.\n       In 1827, the Nikolaevsky Palace was built for the exiled Nikolai Pavlovich and his family in Eastern Constantinople, around which the so-called Russian quarter was established. Here Russian emigrants founded a printing press producing newspapers in Russian and German.\n       The Russian quarter also saw the founding of the Church of the Army of Saint George in 1829, where Russian emigrants performed rites according to the Russian Orthodox Church.\n       The Nikolaevsky Palace became the meeting place of the Russian monarchist association in exile, led from 1830 to 1836 by the writer Prince Vyazemsky, author of the novel 'Waterloo.'\n       The attitude of the local population of the Romean capital towards the Russian monarchist emigrants was, to put it mildly, unfriendly due to the political confrontation between the Romean and Russian empires over the past 500 years.\n       However, over time, the influx of Russian emigrants arriving in Romea after the Decembrist uprising was able to integrate into the international life of the world's largest city.\n       Nikolai Pavlovich, after arriving in the Romean Empire, spent 23 years trying to negotiate with European monarchies for help in suppressing the Decembrist uprising but failed to interest the governments of Prussia, Austria, and Romea, though he did secure a dynastic marriage between the Romanov and Zachareas houses by marrying his eldest daughter to the Emperor of Romea’s nephew in 1845. The marriage was unsuccessful and ended in divorce in 1847. Nikolai Romanov managed to negotiate with Emperor Augustus II to maintain the political alliance.\n       However, Emperor Augustus II, understanding all the risks, made no attempts to pressure Decembrist Russia and adhered to his father’s old policy on the Russian question.\n       In any case, Nikolai Romanov continues to believe that one day he will reclaim what rightfully belongs to his house and avenge the Decembrist movement for its humiliations in 1825."

 byz_lore.6.d:0 "     In recent decades, many have tried to take away our status as the monopoly holder of Asian goods, but none of our opponents have succeeded. However good times await our economy, we must not rest on our laurels. Recent decisions on economic matters have made the golden skifat the most expensive and sought-after currency in trade, but if we look beyond trade successes, internal economic growth has begun to slow in recent years.\n     As of January 1, 1849, the average worker’s wage in Constantinople is 1 golden skifat monthly, the highest salary in all of Europe. Meanwhile, in Greece, the average worker earns only 15 silver skifats (0.75 golden skifats), followed by the Caucasus with 10 silver skifats, and the most lagging Anatolia with a meager 5 silver skifats. If this disparity persists, social stratification will accelerate not just among population groups but entire cultures, which may have catastrophic consequences in the future.\n     While the internal market may not please Romean economists, the external market is where they dominate. Over the last 50 years, the Romean skifat has become the strongest currency, surpassing the rapidly declining French franc. The only foreign currency threatening the skifat is the rapidly growing German mark, but its growth rate has not yet matched ours. Many fear that soon the market will be flooded with the German currency, displacing the skifat from its throne."

 byz_lore.7.d:0 "     Since the emergence of Roman Law in the Roman Empire, the Roman government has sought a compromise between the powers of the emperor, senate, and people. Having endured very difficult times, each century played with imperial laws. But the stable rule of the Zachareas finally set Roman Law on the right course.\n     The history of the Romean Empire’s constitution begins in 1507 when the senate was revived, and the empire needed a law defining the boundaries of power between the senate and emperor. Subsequent changes to the law occurred under every emperor, and surprisingly, most emperors sought to share power with the senate to avoid becoming absolute rulers. The next significant stage was the reform of Constantine XV, which, despite problems with the state apparatus and a Caucasus uprising, is not considered so significant. But it was Constantine who transformed Roman Law into the first constitution of the Romean Empire, which enshrined citizens’ rights and largely separated church from state.\n     Recent years have shown that the constitution of the Zacharias V edition is far from perfect and rather causes problems within the empire. Now the main thing is for Augustus II to carry out constitutional reform before his rule becomes unconstitutional and subsequently illegitimate. But it is this constitution, having undergone all these reforms, that preserves the stability of our crystal empire."

For many years, it was assumed that due to the predominance of the Muslim population in the region, such a question would not arise, as there was always the risk of switching to Islam.\n     The referendum results letter also detailed what awaits Christian churches and Islamic mosques. Preliminary data indicate that all lands belonging to Christian churches and chapels will be transferred to the hands of the Antiochian Pentarchy, while Islamic mosques will be handed over to the newly created Mufti of the Judean lands, centered in Damascus. The success of the referendum likely lies in dividing the state into three mutually respected confessions, unlike before when there was a single center in Jerusalem. The only concern is that the lands around the Second Temple were handed over to the Jewish community for the construction of the Third Temple, funded by money entrusted to Judea for safekeeping."

These peoples have fought for centuries trying to control the region, but it was the Romean Empire that put an end to their wars. Unfortunately, even control over the region does not ensure the necessary level of stability. While Georgians and Armenians may have integrated into society over the centuries, the opposing camp continues to resist. As a result, the region continues to bleed, destroying both sides of the conflict.\n     As of January 1, 1849, the Caucasus is in agony.

Positive dynamics were also shown by the exchange of lands in Judea for lands within Anatolia, allowing the Islamic population to peacefully relocate to Anatolia.\n     As of January 1, 1849, the Judean Federation is probably the most stable place outside the central lands of the Empire. Many are concerned about the rise of separatism in Anatolia and the Caucasus, but Judea consistently avoids this problem. Many believe this is truly the Promised Land.

Due to years of Muslim oppression of the Assyrians, liberation by our forces was met as a second coming. This helped us quickly attract local Christian communities to our branch of faith. But despite all our attempts to help the Assyrians take leading positions in the region, Muslim peoples always found ways to resist us, so only the army prevented both sides from starting new bloodshed.\n     As of January 1, 1849, stability in the Mesopotamian region is declining sharply due to the rise of Islamic threats in southern Persia and the growing strength of the Arab state, leading to radicalization of Shia adherents.

Kuchka began teaching Zacharias German and French using a rather original alphabet. He painted Gothic letters on German toy soldiers and Latin letters on French ones, quickly teaching the prince reading and arithmetic through toy soldiers and a folding fortress.\n        Empress Catherine's greatest concern in raising Zacharias was to steer him away from his early fascination with military affairs. The passion for the technical side of military matters, instilled in Romea by Zacharias V, had long been present in the basileus family — Augustus II, despite his liberalism, was a fervent supporter of the military parade and its intricacies, as were Georgios and Arkadios Zachareas. The younger children matched the elders in this passion. The young prince, following the example of his father and brother, had a special attraction to military toys and stories of ancient commanders from early childhood.

The prince tries to be refined, as befitting any of the Zachareas line, attempting to make a good impression, reading Paleologos' poetry, which draws the attention of young ladies.\n     Dorothea Vasilakis — a social beauty rare to find — was the center of attention at all balls.

Dorothea Vasilakis thanked the prince for dedicating poems to her and gave him a lesson: before putting words on paper, he should think several times about their meaning and significance, so that over time those to whom he dedicates them will be proud of them.\n       The prince responded questioningly, 'Do you not now even take pride in my poems?'\n      Dorothea, trying not to anger the prince, replied, 'Of course not, you and your poems are still in infancy.'\n      But her words had the opposite effect, and the prince continued the dialogue, irritated. 'What a strange phenomenon, you so often remind me that I am still a child to you.'\n- 'How shameful for you, Zaharka — it’s true, I am 18 and have been in society for three winters, and you are only standing at the threshold of this world and will not soon cross it.'\n- 'From your tone, I see my poems are foolish to you and need rewriting, especially the last stanza.'\n     Prince Zacharias took back his poems from Dorothea and left the formal evening, heading to the boarding school. On the way to the carriage, he tore up and threw away the poems dedicated to Dorothea."

Zacharias gathers friends at night, they sit riding one on top of another. The one on top covers himself and the imaginary horse with a sheet, holding a glass of water. At Zacharias’ signal, the squadron gallops toward the victim’s bed, lifts the blanket, and pours water on their head.\n        Among Zacharias’ friends is cadet Mehmed Ahmedoglu; from the first day, an inexplicable rivalry formed between them, expressed in neither allowing the other to stand out among the cadets.

Thanks to his mother's efforts, the prince was assigned to the Constantinople Regiment of the Romean Guard after the academy. Empress Catherine spared no expense equipping her son well and providing the young cornet with everything necessary for a junior guard officer.\n       At that time, Zacharias was obsessed with horses — a rather expensive pleasure. His new horse, 'Rapador,' was purchased from Field Marshal Zacharias Rodiniadis. Besides this horse, the prince's personal stable held four horses, including an Artsakh steed gifted by Prince Sergius Zachareas on the heir's 13th birthday.\n      To celebrate the prince's return, a grand ball was held at the Holy Palace, inviting all nobles and dignitaries of the Second Rome. At this ball, he met Dorothea Vasilakis again. Zacharias knew Dorothea's secret — she was engaged to Alexandra Spanos's brother. He boldly suspected she wanted to marry not for love but for calculation, as Spanos owned several large estates and 10,000 slave souls. Spanos would soon be in Constantinople; Prince Zacharias knew this.\nZacharias invited her to a waltz and boldly kissed Dorothea's hand in front of all nobles after the dance. With this decisive act, heedless of publicity, he won her over, breaking off the engagement with Spanos, and Dorothea changed her view of the prince."

While Zacharias viewed the Caucasus events as a tragedy, Spanos was convinced that a scorched earth tactic was necessary against the mountaineers. Spanos tried to demonstrate superiority over the mountaineers by his very appearance, while Zacharias, after numerous letters from his cousin and stories from his father, developed great respect for the peoples of the North Caucasus.\n      At the celebration, Spanos and Zacharias argued on this topic; the prince brilliantly mocked Spanos's radical views, and Spanos, in turn, lacked wit to respond adequately.\n        Offended by the prince's words, Spanos threw down his glove before Zacharias, a gesture meaning he challenged the prince to a duel. Imperial guards disguised in ballroom tailcoats surrounded Spanos, but Zacharias, performing the small Romean salute gesture, ordered the guards to step back and took Spanos's glove, accepting the duel challenge."

To the north lies a mountain ridge.\n        Witnesses recalled that when Zacharias and Spanos stood fifteen fathoms apart, Spanos approached the barrier and, seeing Zacharias lowered his pistol and unwilling to shoot, shouted: — 'Shoot, or I will kill you!'\n— 'I do not shoot people over trifles,' replied Zacharias.\n— 'I do,' retorted Spanos, aiming.\n      He aimed at Zacharias for so long without raising his pistol that witnesses shouted: — 'Shoot or we will separate you!'\n     Spanos fired but missed; the bullet passed by — recounted Nikiforos Angelos, who was present.\n     The storm rumbled and howled mournfully, lightning flashed brilliantly. When it was Zacharias’s turn to shoot, he deliberately fired into the air, showing he did not intend to harm his opponent and decided to end the duel with reconciliation. According to noble society laws, to restore honor, duelists could exchange two shots and reconcile, which Zacharias and Spanos did, then they went to dine at the Nicomedia fortress."

The engagement day was set, when Prince Zacharias was to visit the Vasilakis estate and propose to the future bride.\n       On the appointed day, after Sunday service, Prince Zacharias, accompanied by his friends Nikiforos Angelos and Konstantin Kantakouzenos, as well as a group of musicians, visited the Vasilakis estate. Dorothea agreed, and the groom entered the bride’s room to inspect the dowry, as per Romean marriage traditions. Afterwards, a torchlit procession accompanied by friends and guests proceeded to the church. The bride and groom wore white garments resembling baptismal robes. Apples and roses, symbols of fertility and abundance, were thrown at their feet.\n      The wedding ceremony included the placing of crowns (symbols of the marriage of Christ and the Church, as well as martyrdom), a common communion, and the drinking of a cup of wine, which was broken after the ceremony.

Among the guests, the Minister of Economic Affairs of Romea, Josef Ludwig Armansperg, stood out. Having drunk too much, he sang bawdy songs in the Hellenic language and was expelled from the Holy Palace.\n     When night fell, guests accompanied the newlyweds to their chamber with songs and woke them in the morning with songs. Since the 7th century, it became tradition for the groom to give the bride a ring and belt. Zacharias gifted Dorothea a ring and belt when they first entered their chambers. The ring was flat or octagonal. If octagonal, its faces were decorated with biblical scenes, and the center depicted the marriage ceremony.\nThe next day featured the important ritual of presenting the bride to the people, conducted very lavishly. Songs for the choir accompanying the imperial wedding ceremony were written by the most famous rhetoricians of the time. The wedding feast lasted quite long: five days."

Honestly, I expected a young man your age to come late in the evening,' Augustus said calmly. 'I understand you have a girlfriend?'\n— 'Yes, father...' the prince replied nervously.\n— 'Zacharias, I am your father; you need not fear me. Rumors reached me about how she treats you; is that normal for you?' — as the emperor spoke, he slowly rose from his chair and approached the window. — 'Son, I understand you are still very young, and this conversation may leave a mark on you, but I cannot just watch how... these nobles treat you. You know, someday this entire empire will belong to you, and do you want to be bossed around? For the emperor to endure contemptuous treatment?'\n— 'But, father... I like her; she is smart and modest...' Zacharias began to justify himself.\n— 'A modest girl?!' — as soon as Augustus said this, he sighed. — 'Young Zacharias, I cannot understand this youthful infatuation, but I want to tell you that at such an early age, it is more weakness than anything good. Forgive my outburst, but please, son... get a grip, start studying, take care of yourself. Both your grandfather and I ascended the throne quite early and were not even allowed to live for ourselves. I want to ask you to get serious so that in the future you can calmly govern our state.'\n— 'Does anyone ask what I want? Why do you all talk about what I owe someone?' — Zacharias replied.\n— 'Because those called emperors are deprived of the right to do what they want.

'Of course, we understand you want to do your own things and not study and prepare to become a ruler, but, my prince, such is the fate of any heir. The truth is, you are still a child and may enjoy amusements.'\n     The prince slowly shifted his gaze from the city to his tutor. — 'Nestor, will I never be able to choose what I want to do?' he said with slight sadness.\n— 'Not quite. You may enjoy yourself while you are a child,' Nestor replied with a smile. 'What you mean by choice is called freedom. Unfortunately, few can truly be called free. The whole world is a collection of rules and conditions. In defense of this world, I say this is the world of adults, and your world is only in your hands.

Such education has been common among rulers in the German region in recent years. The politics of this region have been among the most successful this century.\n     Classical military education typical for all monarchs of Europe. According to tradition, a ruler must experience soldierly hardships, but in reality, such 'soldiers' usually lived in royal, not soldierly conditions.\n     The prince also had the option to try to combine diplomatic and political education with military training.

Although Zacharias was not the most talented student, both the guys and teachers noted his innovative approach to everything.\n     As soon as it became known that the prince was part of a group of boys who were not from the high nobility but from the lower, the emperor was immediately informed, but he, in turn, emphasized that a person’s qualities are determined not by origin but by upbringing.

While the prince was playing chess, one of the new servants sat opposite him and asked if he could play too. Zacharias was surprised that a seven-year-old servant wanted to play chess with him but did not refuse. Chess became the start of a long day, during which they played many games.\n    While they were having fun, Zacharias’ mother Catherine and her friend Maria Alexandrovna watched them. They were amused by the children playing, but closer to evening, both Maria and Catherine began to think that the prince was not noticing something.\n\n— 'Is it just me, or does your son not notice that his partner isn’t a boy?' Maria said. — 'I don’t want to accuse him of anything, but boys at 13 should already see the difference between girls and boys.'\n— 'Come on, Maria. Probably the problem is that we dressed your daughter in a male servant’s outfit,' Catherine replied. — 'Zaharka is used to seeing male servants dressed like that. And sorry again that I couldn’t find suitable clothes for your daughter.'\n— 'What can you do with you Hellenes,' Maria said with a smile. — 'It’s okay, Catherine, we are only guests here anyway.

And second, do you like seeing my son with a "boy" or with your daughter?' the Empress replied.\n— 'With your daughter, of course. But I’m sure even if they want to be together, neither Augustus nor Alexander will approve of this relationship,' Maria said sadly. — 'It’s hard for them not to notice the old grudges between our families.'\n— 'As for me, if something happens between Zacharias and your Alexandra, it would be a great reason to finally end the feud between our families,' Catherine replied."

Unfortunately, they have no choice, you understand that yourself.'\n— 'No, and again no. My friend, the world revolves around you, not just because you are a prince or something else. It’s much simpler, it’s all because of what kind of person you are,' Velisarius said sharply. — 'I think you will still see the power of words, but it will not be an imperial decree, but your natural charisma.'\n     After this conversation, Zacharias was left pondering how his words could gain power beyond what was given to him at birth. Some time later, after Velisarius had already left, Zacharias decided to find another interlocutor to practice his speech. And as soon as the prince walked down the corridor, he ran into those he would have to talk to...\n     Before the prince stood the boys who bullied others. — 'Hey, prince,' one of the boys called out. — 'Don’t you want to chat, discuss life and all that?'\n— 'No, I don’t want to...' the prince said cautiously, trying to leave as quickly as possible.\n— 'Are you sure you don’t want to chat?' they continued.\n— 'No, thank you.'

Velisarius answered. — 'No, I just see the fire in your eyes. Your gaze now reminds me of the paintings of Zacharias "the Great." That’s why I offer my help, because are we Romans tyrants? Do we seek to take all power into our hands? What about the republic? What about the legendary path of our country? I’m not saying we should abandon the monarchy, but it’s time to return power to the people, because it’s no coincidence that "Senatus Populus Quiritium Romanus" once again adorns government buildings.'\n— 'Velisarius, but I am not emperor to decide such things...' the prince replied. — 'And I’m not sure I want that.'\n— 'It’s my job to offer you help in the future, and it’s yours to accept it or not,' Velisarius replied. — 'Just looking at how monarchism burns in Europe, I understand that this flame may spread to us.

After about half an hour of wandering, the prince seemed to find something resembling sleeping quarters. Entering the first room, he saw a rather poor room with a couple of beds and nightstands. No carpets on the walls, no tapestries, everything was simple and practical. Zacharias was about to leave but then heard the warden again, so he had to stay in the room.

But when news reached Zacharias that they would arrive any day, he began preparing for their arrival.\n     The prince was dressed to the nines and stood near his mother. As soon as the carriage with the familiar coat of arms arrived, the prince began helping the guests descend from their coach. Everything was fine until his eyes fell on the beautiful Alexandra, after which Zacharias froze. Although Alexandra was only 9 years old, her appearance already resembled the most beautiful girls of Hellenic mythology. The prince was clearly unprepared for the fact that this year Aphrodite herself would visit him.\n— 'Um... Alexandra, you are beautiful,' the prince managed to say with great difficulty.\n— 'Zaharka, you flatter me. Of course, the servants at our estate also say that I am growing into quite the Russian beauty,' Alexandra said cautiously. — 'But it is unbecoming for a Roman prince to humiliate himself for an ordinary Russian noblewoman.'\n— 'Alexandra, you don’t understand,' the prince still spoke with difficulty. — 'I want you to become my wife in the future.'\n     This phrase stunned not only Maria but even Catherine, who was about to interrupt her son, but Alexandra herself broke the pause: — 'Of course, it’s unexpected, but Zacharias, I am only 9 years old, and you are 15; is it worth laughing about?' she said with a smile. — 'Let’s grow up first, and then we’ll think about what kind of relationship to have.'\n— 'You are not only beautiful externally but also incomparable in mind...' the prince still spoke with difficulty. — 'I will definitely wait. I promise I will wait until you grow up, and then I will do everything so that your hand is mine. I promise.'"

 byz_zakharias.27.d:0 "     As the new academic year began, Zacharias was informed that he needed to choose where he would do his internship. The available options for the prince were: the main consulate of Constantinople or the imperial palace. Both options had their pros and cons.\n     In the Constantinople consulate, liberal forces of the Empire had firmly settled in recent years. Mainly representatives of the Trade and People’s factions of the senate work there. Obviously, the main downside is the liberal ideas dwelling there, but the upside is much greater because real diplomacy happens there. After all, this consulate has been handling diplomatic relations for the last 50 years.\n     The imperial palace is a more interesting option because Zacharias could see how the imperial bureaucracy works firsthand. As for the palace staff, almost all are members of the Imperial faction, which speaks not only of their loyalty but also of strong political ties with the Emperor himself. However, the dominance of this faction has made this place very conservative, causing it to lose its leading role as the main diplomatic building of the Empire.\n     Zacharias faced this choice. On one hand, he could continue to deepen his liberal spirit; on the other, he could get closer to the emperor’s work than ever before. While pondering this, the prince often thought about Velisarius and how he would act in this situation..."

But the prince was full of doubts because every step he had taken led to something he did not understand himself. Was this the path he dreamed of?\n     The ceremony began with congratulations to the most successful students, among whom Zacharias unfortunately was not included. Initially, the prince imagined that such a ceremony should inspire young minds to new achievements, but again he saw how society divides people into successful and not. How can a state, where even an Arab Bedouin is a citizen, so strongly stratify society? The prince’s thoughts continued until he was called to the stage to be congratulated, but for what?\n     As soon as Zacharias approached the podium, the entire hall immediately focused on him. It was as if the universe expected something from him. Seeing that the prince did not know what to say, the director hinted that he was called as the most active student.\n— 'I see. You want to call me the most active student,' Zacharias slowly looked around the hall. — 'But there are those here more deserving of this. I have been listening all evening to how you praise those who spent more time studying, how much better they are than us. But are grades a measure of a person? No, a person is primarily defined by actions; one can be hopelessly foolish but incredibly humane. Therefore, I want to congratulate everyone who has reached this point, not only the best. Each of you has come a long way and is now here; you can be proud of yourselves. So let us together build our Empire in the future!'\n     After these words, the prince hurriedly left both the podium and the hall. While walking down the corridor, Zacharias wondered when he would face the consequences of such a speech."

Although initially the prince did not wish to attend, he heard that Velisarius would be there, which immediately changed his mind.\n     Zacharias arrived in the midst of the ball, when dancing, drinking, and much more was already actively happening. He looked with mild displeasure at how the nobles indulged themselves that evening while the servants worked hard for them. But when Zacharias’ gaze found Velisarius, the prince hurried to him.\n— 'Good evening, Velisarius, I did not expect to see you at this event,' Zacharias began. — 'I thought such a life would even be offensive to you.'\n— 'Really? Hmm... That’s not the image I try to maintain,' Velisarius replied with a smile. — 'I’m here because of my younger brother, who is also graduating.'\n— 'You never told me you had a brother,' the prince was surprised.\n— 'You see, he’s not like me. He’s quite conservative,' Velisarius said with a hint of sadness. — 'I think this is not the acquaintance that would do you good, Zacharias.'\nWhile the old friends talked, they did not notice a group of nobles approaching who clearly recognized the prince. — 'Zaharka, is that you?' a girl said with a smirk.\n— 'Dorothea, what an unpleasant meeting,' Zacharias replied coldly.\n— 'Hey, I thought you liked me before; has our hopeless prince found someone?' Dorothea mocked the prince. — 'Who needs such a clumsy, awkward bear?'\n— 'I ask you to stop mocking my friend, madam,' Velisarius said.\n— 'And who are you?' Dorothea said, turning her gaze to Velisarius. — 'Oh... well, forgive us, we must go now.'\n     After these words, she and her company quickly left the prince’s company. Velisarius looked at Zacharias, who was clearly struggling to hold something back inside.\n— 'My friend, I don’t know what’s on your mind, but act,' Velisarius said kindly.\n— 'I must find her... I know where the Russian quarter is,' Zacharias replied hastily.\n     After that, the prince hurriedly left the event and went in search of the one who lived in his heart. Meanwhile, Velisarius continued watching to ensure no one else dared to slander his friend at the ball."

What if she forgot the promise? What if this whole journey was in vain? But Zacharias quickly cast aside fear and knocked. The door was quickly opened by servants who did not expect to see the prince at the threshold, so he was not immediately let in. But as soon as the question of who was before them ceased, the prince, accompanied, went in search of Alexandra on the estate grounds and found her in the main hall.\n— 'Dear Alexandra, please answer me,' Zacharias said with slight nervousness. — 'Do you still remember the promise we made last summer?'\n— 'Of course I remember, Zacharias,' Alexandra said with a smile. — 'But only a year has passed since we made it; have we grown up in that time? Well, you have, but I’m still a child.'\n— 'No, Alexandra, you are not a child but the most beautiful girl in the world,' the prince interrupted her. — 'I understand how this sounds. But do you agree to become my wife in the future? Do you agree to be betrothed to me until you are old enough for a full marriage?'\n— 'Such things are not decided immediately...' she clearly pondered. — 'Although, you know, Zacharias, I don’t know what will happen in 6 or 8 years, but I’m sure no one else will seek my hand as you do. I agree, but on one condition.'\n— 'For you, I am ready for anything,' Zacharias answered boldly.\n— 'Then listen,' Alexandra said with a smile. — 'I want our marriage to follow the traditions of both Orthodoxy and your Romean Christianity. Also, you need written permission from my father for this.'\n— 'For you, my lady, I am ready to seek even personal approval,' the prince replied. — 'God and all present here are my witnesses; I promise to obtain any permissions, any decisions, but in the end, we will be together. Please bring the ring!'"

His choice fell on a prestigious military school, where today he first stepped over the threshold of the barracks.\n     The conditions here were quite different from what the young aristocrat was used to. The barracks where the prince was placed were cold and gloomy, with simple wooden beds standing in rows along the walls. The air was filled with the smells of dampness and sweat, mixed with smoke from coal stoves. The windows barely let in light, creating an atmosphere of perpetual twilight.\n     Zacharias stood in the middle of the room, feeling his heart pounding in his chest. He had always known military service would require sacrifices, but the reality was much harsher than he could imagine. Memories of the warm palace chambers, soft beds, and caring servants flashed through his mind. Here, he was surrounded only by silence and quiet, broken only by the occasional sounds of footsteps and whispers of other cadets.\n     When the barracks door opened and the other cadets entered, Zacharias was overwhelmed by loneliness. The boys looked at him with curiosity and distrust. Some saw in him a future leader; others saw just a spoiled aristocrat who would have a hard time in these walls. But no one approached him to greet or offer help.\n     Zacharias felt as if the whole world had frozen around him. He understood that from now on, his fate depended only on himself. He had to prove to everyone that he deserved to bear the title of prince and become a worthy protector of his people."

The cold and gloomy barracks that initially frightened the young aristocrat had become a second home to him. Life at the school was harsh, but Zacharias began to understand that it was here that true character was formed.\n     Every morning began the same way: a sharp shout from the sergeant interrupted brief sleep, and cadets instantly rose from their beds. Long hours of training, marching, and studying military theory followed. Despite his high status, Zacharias had to perform the same tasks as other students. There was no special treatment — on the contrary, the school commanders demanded even greater diligence and dedication from him.\n     One day, after an especially hard day when his muscles ached and his legs barely moved, Zacharias reflected. At first, he felt like a stranger among the other cadets, but now they had become true comrades. He saw how each of them tried their best, how they supported each other in difficult moments. And Zacharias realized that the discipline and hardening he received here were necessary to become a true leader.\n     He remembered his first days at the school when everything seemed so alien and frightening. Now he felt pride that he had overcome fear and uncertainty. Zacharias began to understand that military life was not only hard work but also an opportunity to gain strength of spirit and loyal friends."

The air was filled with excitement and anticipation. Each young man carefully checked his uniform, striving to look impeccable. Zacharias, standing in one of the front rows, felt a special responsibility. Thanks to his success in studies and training, he was chosen as one of the leaders of the column.\n     When the command to start moving was given, the column of cadets left the school gates and headed to the city center. The townspeople had already gathered on the streets to watch the solemn procession. People greeted the young warriors with applause and joyful cheers. Children waved their hands, and adults bowed respectfully, seeing how orderly and confidently the future soldiers marched.\n     Zacharias walked at the front, trying to keep a steady pace and a straight back. He felt the gazes of hundreds of people directed at him. For the first time in his life, he realized how great his role was and how important it was to be an example for others. Memories of his first days at the school, when everything seemed so difficult and incomprehensible, flashed through his mind. Now he proudly marched through the streets of his hometown, knowing he had taken a big step forward.\n     In Zacharias’s soul rose a feeling of pride and satisfaction. He thought about how much effort it took to reach this moment and about the many trials that awaited him ahead. But now, at this moment, he felt part of something great and significant. Being a soldier is not just a profession; it is a calling, and Zacharias is ready to give all his strength to serve his people."

He had never dreamed of such recognition, but now that it had happened, he felt a huge responsibility. His gaze swept over the faces of his comrades, and he saw trust and confidence in their eyes. They truly believed in him, and this filled his heart with joy and pride.\n     One of the senior officers approached Zacharias and firmly shook his hand.\n— 'Well done, prince,' he said. — 'You have proven yourself a worthy leader. Now your task is to lead your platoon to success. I am confident you will succeed.'\n     Zacharias nodded, feeling a wave of determination rise within him.

Vasily said, looking directly at Zacharias. — 'Today we are gathered here to celebrate the achievement of one of our best students.

His contribution to our common mission cannot be overstated.'\n     The hall erupted in applause. Everyone knew the speech was about Zacharias’s promotion.

From now on, you are no longer a cadet but a junior officer of our glorious army!'\n     Zacharias stood up, feeling blood rush to his face. He could not believe this was really happening. General Vasily approached him and presented the insignia of a junior officer. Tears of joy and gratitude filled Zacharias’s eyes.\n— 'Thank you, sir,' Zacharias said quietly. — 'I promise to carry the officer’s rank with honor and continue to serve our country with honor and courage.'\n     General Vasily smiled and shook the new junior officer’s hand firmly. — 'We believe in you, Zacharias.

Your behavior and achievements over the past months have shown that you possess all these qualities. Therefore, today we are pleased to inform you that you have been awarded the smallest medal for merits to the Romean Empire.'\n     Zacharias stood, unable to believe his ears. The Medal for Merits was a rare award given only to the most worthy. He could not believe this was happening to him.\n     Colonel Georgy took the medal and pinned it to Zacharias’s uniform. Then he stepped back, giving the floor to Julius Romanus. The leader of the Imperial Guard approached and extended his hand.\n— 'Congratulations, Junior Officer Zacharias,' Julius said. — 'Your work and striving for perfection serve as an example to all of us. Keep it up, and I am sure great achievements await you ahead.'\n     Zacharias bowed, accepting the congratulations. Inside him swirled a sea of emotions: pride, gratitude, joy. He understood that this medal was not just a sign of recognition but an obligation to continue serving his country with the same dedication and loyalty.\n     After the ceremony, Zacharias returned to his room to calm down and reflect on what had happened. He took off the medal and looked at it for a long time, recalling all the hardships and successes that had led him to this moment.

The rebels looked strange: they were poorly armed, most wore ordinary civilian clothes. Their actions seemed chaotic and desperate. On the other hand, the garrison soldiers acted decisively and mercilessly, using all their available power.\n     Zacharias stopped, trying to figure out the situation. Something in the rebels’ behavior made him think. Perhaps they really had reasons for discontent? Or maybe it was just a group of criminals taking advantage of the moment?\n     But then he noticed a garrison soldier shooting without hesitation at a wounded rebel lying on the ground. This sight shocked Zacharias. He always believed the army should protect the people, not mercilessly destroy them.\n     The prince realized he needed to act. The question was urgent: join the garrison and help suppress the rebellion or try to protect the civilians, even if they had risen in revolt?\n     His inner voice told him he could not remain indifferent to the people’s suffering. Even if the rebels were wrong, they deserved fair treatment. Zacharias took a deep breath and made a decision."

But at that moment, his thoughts were far away.\n     Amid the general jubilation and joy, Zacharias suddenly remembered the summer four years ago when he first met Alexandra Alexandrovna Romanova.

Her kindness and sincerity left an indelible mark on his heart.\n     As the march continued, Zacharias mentally returned to those warm days spent at the summer palace.

Although Alexandra was younger than the prince, her thoughts and ideas were much older than they should have been.\n     As soon as the official part of the event ended, Zacharias quickly left the square.

Tall, in German uniform, a young man — not what the awaiting people expected, but he was as he was.\n       Almost immediately, Zacharias, accompanied by the imperial guard, left the railway station and went to the palace to resolve issues caused by his absence. As soon as the prince began recounting all the years of his education, it was difficult for him to switch from German to Hellenic.

However, despite these reflections, Velisarius promised Zacharias that if he accepted his help, he would do everything possible for Zacharias to live a full life and for the Romean Empire to strengthen under his leadership.\n       This conversation strengthened Zacharias’s belief in his own strength and future. He realized he had enormous potential, and by accepting Velisarius’s support, he could become an outstanding leader, as his father had always dreamed.\n       Now the prince faced only one task: to find one of the most important people in his life, the one who brightened every summer with her carefree and kind smile..."

 byz_zakharias.217.d:0 "        When Zacharias learned the results of his final exam, he did not feel the excitement he expected. The grade was above average but did not reach the heights he hoped for. This event made him reflect on his current position and compare himself to Caesar, whom he had always admired. After this day, the friends had another dialogue in the library;\n— 'I expected my result to be better. Why didn’t I achieve the highest scores? Maybe my preparation was not intensive enough?' Zacharias said sadly.\n— 'You know, Zacharias, success often depends not only on the number of hours spent with books but also on your attitude toward studying,' Velisarius calmly replied. — 'You should not just mechanically memorize facts but penetrate the essence of the subject, analyze and synthesize information. Sometimes results reflect not only the amount of literature read but also the depth of understanding of the material.'\n— 'Maybe I relied too much on my memory and did not pay attention to analytical thinking. I know I can work better, but sometimes it’s hard to make myself think deeper,' the prince honestly admitted.\n— 'That’s normal, Zacharias. Many students face this problem. But the most important thing is your willingness to correct mistakes and strive for perfection. Remember, the path to greatness is paved with thousands of small steps, and each one is important,' Velisarius began encouraging him. — 'The main thing is not to stop at the achieved level but to constantly move forward.'\n— 'Thank you, Velisarius. I understand that great challenges await me, and I am ready to work on myself. I want to prove that I am capable of more than just good grades,' Zacharias said with a note of joy.\n— 'Zacharias, you have already made a big step forward, and that shows your potential. If you continue to make efforts and strive for improvement, new horizons will open to you. You have all the necessary qualities to achieve great goals. The main thing is not to forget your determination and keep moving forward despite temporary failures,' Velisarius continued.\n— 'Yes, I understand that success depends on my attitude. I will try to prepare better and pay more attention to details. I want to achieve more than just average results,' the prince replied joyfully.\n— 'Excellent, Zacharias. That’s the right attitude. You have a long way ahead, but if you work hard and don’t give up in the face of difficulties, you can achieve greatness. Always remember that strength lies not only in results but also in your will to win,' Velisarius concluded.\n— 'Thank you, Velisarius, this really means a lot to me,' Zacharias said more confidently. — 'But now I have another task. Amid all this studying, I forgot about the promise to find one very important person to me.'\n— 'Well, then, good luck, my young friend. I wish you success in your search,' Velisarius concluded the dialogue, as the prince was already preparing to leave."

So let’s take it!" — Zergius spoke inspiringly.\n     The signal to attack sounded, the troops advanced, and the cannons began firing aimed shots at the left flank of the fortress’s defensive fortifications.\n     The cannons managed to breach the wall, and the main forces of the Romeans poured in. The mountaineers tried to repel them but failed due to the numerical superiority and element of surprise on the Romeans’ side. In the heat of the battle for the fortress, the mountaineer commander Suaib-Mulla attempted to kill Prince Zergius, who led the vanguard of the Romeans into the main hall of the fortress. The experienced Suaib-Mulla disarmed the prince in a duel, wounded him, and was about to kill Zergius when suddenly the mountaineer was shot in the back by Ober-Lieutenant Zakaryan. Prince Zergius was wounded in the leg and bleeding but was able to continue coordinating the Romean unit’s advance. After an hour of battle, the mountain fortress was taken, the mountaineer garrison of 250 men was wiped out, and Prince Zergius’s forces suffered minimal losses."

Already at the stage of approaching the walls, Prince Zergius’s forces suffered significant casualties, but the prince refused to order a retreat.\n     After 18 minutes of fighting, the first Romean soldier climbed the wall using a hook, and the Romeans managed to seize the initiative.\n     Prince Zergius took personal command of the Romean vanguard and led them in the assault on the inner courtyard. The battle was tough, but gradually the Romeans crushed the mountaineers.\n     Lieutenant Spanos with the 3rd platoon bypassed the fortress from the south and blocked the exit for the mountaineers, preventing them from leaving the fortress.\n     The mountaineer commander Saib-Mulla led the surviving Circassians and Abadigez in a suicidal counterattack. During the battle, he managed to kill Ober-Lieutenant Zakaryan and severely wound Prince Zergius, but the prince was able to defeat Saib in combat. The mountaineers were defeated and surrounded. However, the Romean victory came at a high cost; the 501st Tagma lost 500 men during the battle, many of whom died in the early stages of the assault."

According to Ovanes Bagratuni, he revealed no information under torture related to the "Venus" project, and the mountaineers and their sponsors know nothing about the mortar under construction.\n     Prince Zergius decided not to leave the fortress and to fortify it, building a fortified army post there. Colonel Bagratuni was transported by the military airship "Narses" to Tiflis, where after a course of treatment he was to return to work on the mortar."

They have ambushed the cortege of Prince Konstantin’s eldest son, Alexander, and taken him captive; now the mountaineers are coming here." — said the messenger, gasping for breath.\n— "Send my field doctor here quickly, Lieutenant Spanos, sound the general assembly and form up the personnel, prepare for an attack." — Zergius replied in haste.\n— "It will be done, Major General!" — answered one of the commanders.\n     The messenger spoke the truth; within hours, the local mountains were filled with hordes of mountaineers. Shamil raised the banners of all loyal Caucasian tribes and emirs, intending to reclaim something important to him in this fortress. Despite the fact that these soldiers were veterans of many battles, the Romean soldiers were gripped by stupor; they all understood that this battle would be the last for most of them.\n     Imam Shamil sent his envoy to the fortress gates for negotiations; he was met by Prince Zergius and Lieutenant Spanos.\n— "Praise be to Allah, our great Imam Shamil gives you a chance to survive. He will spare the lives of you infidels if your army leaves the fortress and surrenders Ovanes Bagratuni!" — Shamil’s envoy said to Prince Zergius in a rude tone.\n— "Tell your imam that I will gladly cut off his head and impale his rebellious head on a pike in Constantinople; get lost, dog! As long as I and my men live, you shall not pass! The Holy Theotokos will help us!" — the prince shouted confidently.\n     Shamil’s envoy turned and galloped back to his master’s camp, insulted and humiliated.

Prince Zergius ordered the unit commanders to watch over the soldiers so that, as the prince put it, the servicemen would not disgrace the honor of their uniforms or commit any actions not prescribed by the regulations.\n     When the mountaineers finished their prayer, the regimental chaplain of the 501st Tagma, Ter-Akopyan, climbed the wall and began blessing the soldiers for victory in battle — this gave the camp defenders a bit of confidence in the righteousness of their cause, and the morale among the Romeans became steadily manageable.\n     After this, a brief lull occurred until the mountaineers brought out Alexander Zachareas and several prisoners and raised them on the central elevation before the fortress, preparing to execute them. Prince Zergius made the difficult decision to organize a sortie and save the youth from death, personally leading a detachment of veterans to the place of the future execution. Alexander stood fearless and confident, just like a young lion. He raised his right hand toward the sun and shouted the Zachareas family motto, “Hope and Strength.” The executioner grabbed the youth by the head, drew his saber, and slit the boy’s throat — it was Jamaluddin, one of Shamil’s sons, who killed Alexander. The lifeless body of imperial blood fell into the mud on the ground; the executioner smirked and wiped his weapon on Alexander’s clothes.\n     Zergius’s detachment, stuck halfway to the execution site, was forced to retreat to the gates under cover of the shooters on the walls.\n     Imam Shamil, seeing the opportunity to eliminate Prince Zergius, ordered the cavalry to attack the Romean sortie.\n     The veteran detachment led by the prince fought valiantly but was pinned down by mountaineer infantry and could not retreat into the fortress. Eventually, after some time, only Zergius remained alive, with cavalry units closing in on him.\n     The prince, seeing and realizing his situation, threw away his pistol, which was out of ammunition, and drew his saber — the weapon of his father, Kamuel Paleologus. The prince proudly prepared to die. Suddenly, a powerful explosion occurred, and the prince was blown by the blast wave toward the gates — it was a salvo from the German latest artillery recently placed by the Romeans on the wall. The mountaineer horsemen who were not destroyed by the shot fled. The Romeans managed to carry the wounded prince to the local fortress hospital. Lieutenant Spanos took command of the garrison in the prince’s absence."

What is happening outside the walls?" Zergius said with difficulty.\n— "Your Highness, over these three days, the mountaineers tried to break through our defense and capture the fortress. But they failed; our people held out, and the enemy switched to a war of attrition. We are surrounded and blockaded in the fortress. The condition of the personnel is terrible; in these three days, we lost three and a half companies, 16 officers, and 800 soldiers. Our ammunition and provisions are running low, and fewer than 500 of us remain, while Shamil has brought additional forces to the fortress, doubling the number of mountaineers since the first day of battle. Yesterday, I managed to send a messenger to Tiflis, but we cannot count on help arriving before Shamil launches the decisive assault. I fear this is the end, Your Highness." reported Lieutenant Spanos.\n— "Gentlemen officers, in the current situation, I see no other way but to continue resistance. If we surrender, our fates will be truly terrible; the barbarians will show no mercy. Be brave, gentlemen! Romea will remember us all as heroes; we fought honorably and with conscience. And I do not want you, glorious soldiers of the Romean Empire, to die as cowards in captivity among savages." concluded the prince.\n     Several hours passed; a gloomy atmosphere reigned in the Romean camp; some wept mourning fallen comrades, some prayed incessantly, and some, understanding that death awaited them soon, recalled home and loved ones. The prince sat in his tent writing a death letter to his beloved Christina Loris-Melikyan.\n— "Beloved Christina, when I left Constantinople a year and a half ago with two goals — to restore order in the Caucasus and find those responsible for my family’s death — it seems I have not found the truth. For 300 years, our empire has waged a war unknown to anyone against the Islamic peoples of the Caucasus who do not wish to live in the civilization and progress offered by our great emperor. This war has exhausted me, Christina. Not because I am tired of fighting. It seems our struggle moves in one direction — toward chaos. Today, I have more questions than answers, and that is why I ventured so far into barbarian lands to find clarity and wisdom left by our ancestors. Christina, if something happens to me… if enemies overcome me or ambitions lead me astray… do not seek justice or revenge. But continue the search for truth for the common good. There are hundreds of stories like mine, and the world will not collapse if one ends. Mon amour!"

 byz_projectvenus.27.d:0 "     The seventh day of the fortress siege was truly harsh and bloody. Throughout the day, the mountaineers attempted once again to take the fortress by force, and the Romean soldiers were forced, with their last strength, to repel several waves of attacks. However, the battle-hardened Romean fighters fulfilled their duty.\n     On the eighth day of the siege, a new envoy of Imam Shamil arrived at the fortress gates, delivering a message from the imam to Prince Zergius, in which the mountaineer leader proposed a temporary ceasefire to conduct negotiations. Both Shamil and Prince Zergius fully understood the situation; Shamil did not want to lose many men besieging a small fortress, and Prince Zergius wished to preserve the lives of his people, at least those who had survived so far. The Romean prince also hoped to buy time during negotiations until reinforcements arrived from Tiflis.\n     On the tenth day, the hostile parties met on neutral ground in a large specially prepared tent. Ahmad Argutinsky, Shamil’s military advisor from Russia, also attended the negotiations.\n— "You do not hide behind high walls, that is commendable. For a Greek, you are very brave. You are reckless but courageous," Ahmad said proudly.\n— "You came here uninvited; return to the mountain paths and go back to your auls," Zergius said confidently.\n— "I will leave only when you return my slave and the documents you stole from me, Romean prince," Shamil replied.\n— "Prince? Who here is a prince? This puppy wearing general’s epaulettes? Would a true prince wage war against the people he swore to protect, then deceive them; abduct children, corrupt wives, and turn them into Romeans?" the Russian spy began to insult.\n— "Many mountaineers voluntarily accept the order of Romean society and become part of it. But does a Russian army officer have the right to be on Romean soil?" Captain Spanos remarked.\n— "He is my guest and is here on my behalf!" Shamil said.\n     Ahmad Argutinsky drew his saber and, swinging it at Prince Zergius, said: — "Your soldiers are watching the negotiations, so let them see how I will stab you like a pig, cut you in half, and see what the Zachareas are made of." But Imam Shamil quickly put the Russian officer in his place and began to speak: — "Do not rush, friend, look around, Romean prince. I have gathered all the warriors of the North Caucasus; behind me are the support of Russia and Britain. What can you oppose to me alone? Tiflis is very far from here; you are alone. You still have a chance to save your people’s lives. I have two conditions; first — you surrender to my captivity and accept Islam, your soldiers also become my prisoners, you return my slave Ovanes Bagratuni, and I will send him to Russia by your order."\n— "Are you such a mountain savage that you thought I would be afraid seeing your herd of ragged flintlock riflemen you call an army? Here I have 500 elite Romean Guard soldiers, armed with the latest military technology from Prussia. 500 men who are not afraid to sacrifice their lives to your greed," Zergius replied.\n— "Be careful, Romean prince; even my mercy has limits!" the Imam replied very displeased.\n— "I have seen the limit of your mercy, barbarian; a few days ago, your son executed a 13-year-old boy by your order, just because he was related to me by blood. And I will tell you this: the son of Rome will never again be under a Muslim’s command. We defeated the Ottomans, Mamluks, and Timurids. Your mountain savages are no match for them," Zergius answered, restraining himself.\n— "Then every son of Rome awaits hell and Shaytan!" Shamil said with rage."

However, the prince managed to gain a considerable amount of time for the arrival of reinforcements — as much as possible given the situation. Now everything was in God’s hands, and the Romean warriors could only pray for the swift arrival of reinforcements.\n     Upon learning the exact number of defending Romean soldiers, Shamil decided to stop waiting for the garrison’s capitulation and ordered the final assault on the fortress to begin tonight.\n     The Romeans loaded the last shells into the cannons and awaited the attack… they were ready to fight to the end and die with honor.\n     At 04:00 local time, the mountaineers’ first units stormed the fortress, led by another son of Imam Shamil, Ghazi-Muhammad. But the Romean soldiers managed to stop them near the remains of the fortress gates; German cannons had exhausted their ammunition, and the Romeans lost their artillery advantage over the mountaineers.\n     The mountaineers continued to press harder and sent more men into the fortress. Understanding the hopelessness of the situation, Captain Spanos proposed a suicidal plan to Prince Zergius: to withdraw most of the fighters through a secret exit from the fortress leading to one of the caves by the river. Then, to blow up the gunpowder supplies left by the mountaineers. Prince Zergius gave the go-ahead and ordered the 1st and 4th companies to retreat into the fortress, while the 3rd company was to distract the mountaineers’ attention so the enemy would not suspect anything.\n     After 20 minutes, Prince Zergius’s main forces managed to retreat, and a powerful explosion destroyed the fortress and everyone inside. Shamil’s warriors who survived and were not in the fortress during the explosion tried to understand what had really happened.\n     By that time, Zergius’s detachment was already at the river and tried to contact their own; army signalman Zilber set up the telegraph and contacted General Ovanes Lazaryan’s operational headquarters. The prince contacted the general and learned that General Lazaryan was moving with a large detachment to reinforce Prince Zergius. Zergius shared information about Shamil’s location with General Lazaryan and received orders to advance through the mountain paths to join forces with the general for a joint attack on Shamil."

His warriors, heavily drunk on wine, were unable to repel the Romean attack. Under cover of machine guns and artillery, the Romean vanguard advanced on the mountaineers, led personally by Captain Spanos. Prince Zergius and General Lazaryan commanded the troops from the operational headquarters.\n     Spanos’s detachment encountered Jamaluddin, who engaged in a duel with the captain. Despite his relatively young age, Jamaluddin was a skilled warrior and was able to fend off the Romean prince’s attacks for some time.\n     Spanos, stepping away from Jamaluddin, picked up someone’s knife from the ground and threw it into Jamaluddin’s body. Shamil’s eldest son writhed in his death agony, and then the captain cut off his head with his saber.\n     The battle was lost for Shamil’s men, and the mountaineers fled the battlefield, abandoning their wounded and dead.\n     Prince Zergius ordered his subordinates to search the battlefield and bring him Shamil’s head, but after spending several hours searching for his corpse, they failed to find it. It later turned out that Shamil had fled with the other surviving mountaineers."

How? We would have won! Only Allah decides the outcome of the battle!" — Hadji shouted in anger.\n— "The outcome of the battle is certainly decided by Allah, but also by the warriors’ resolve, their numbers, the absence of disease, and supplies of drinking water. I lost two of my sons. It is impossible to wage war when the enemy is at your back. How many victories did Allah give us before I led the Caucasian peoples? Tell me... How many before I became imam?" — Shamil replied.\n— "Few... Because our peoples were sinful." — Berzek said.\n— "We are not ready for this war now..." — the imam tried to justify himself.\n— "Then I fear, Shamil, you won’t be imam for long..." — Hadji replied displeased.\n— "We are all dust before Allah, but I am chosen! Thank you for visiting, Hadji Berzek..." — Shamil continued to justify himself.\n— "Shamil, you promised to free the North Caucasus from Roman tyranny! You promised, never forget that!" — Berzek replied very displeased.\n— "Very soon our brothers in Anatolia will take up arms and turn them against the Romeans; our friends in Petrograd have already taken care of this, and then, at the moment of the uprising in Anatolia, we will strike the infidels anew! Together we will crush them! But for now, we must wait for the Crystal Bird to sign its own death sentence!" — Shamil said with some joy."

Despite well-argued reasons about the importance of protecting trade routes and preventing regional conflicts, the Chinese side remained adamant.\n       China’s refusal to accept help was motivated by deep distrust of external interference in matters they consider exclusively internal. According to Chinese leadership, any attempts by third parties to participate in South China Sea security issues constitute a violation of their national sovereignty and pose a threat to the country’s independence.\n       This decision caused a wave of bewilderment and disappointment among those who hoped for productive cooperation in stabilizing the region. Nevertheless, China clearly indicated its intention to independently resolve issues related to the security of its territorial waters and does not require external mediation.\n       The refusal of help cast doubt on the further development of dialogue between Romea and China on regional security issues.

The revision of trade and political ties with China is seen by the Japanese as a necessary condition for further cooperation with Romea.\n       The reception of envoys and agreement to limited diplomacy demonstrate Japan’s readiness for dialogue and seeking new opportunities for interaction. However, the demand to change relations with China indicates the complexity and multilayered nature of the geopolitical situation in the region, where every step has strategic significance."

 byz_anwser.10.t:0 "Diplomatic Deadlock with Japan"
 byz_anwser.10.d:0 "       Japan decisively refused to accept envoys from the Romean Empire, demonstrating unwillingness to engage in any cooperation with European states. This news caused shock and concern among diplomats, especially amid rumors that previous envoys were executed for showing 'audacity.'\n       Such a sharp refusal highlights the closed and isolationist nature of Japanese society, as well as its desire to preserve independence and uniqueness. For European powers accustomed to active diplomacy and trade relations, Japan’s behavior became a real challenge.\n       Romean diplomats now face the task of carefully analyzing the situation and developing a new strategy to establish contact with Japan. However, at present, the future of these relations remains uncertain, and prospects for cooperation seem quite doubtful."

 byz_anwser.11.t:0 "The Japanese Agree to Minimal Trade Concessions"
 byz_anwser.11.d:0 "       Japan’s response to Romea’s proposal to revise trade agreements was positive, but the Japanese side expressed willingness to make only minimal concessions. This meant that although negotiations were progressing, the stability of trade between Asia and Europe remained precarious.\n       Despite both sides’ desire to establish fair and beneficial terms, the Japanese took a firm stance, insisting on maintaining most of their advantages. They agreed only to minor changes, which hardly satisfied Romea’s ambitious plans to balance trade flows.\n       This situation caused some tension, as Romea expected more substantial concessions that could ensure equality in trade and improve economic ties. However, the Japanese side, relying on its dominant regional position, preferred to maintain the status quo, leaving many important aspects unchanged.\n       This outcome left open questions about the further development of trade relations between the two countries. While trade stability was temporarily maintained, the lack of significant breakthroughs created uncertainty and threatened long-term cooperation. Romea continued to seek ways to convince Japan of the need for deeper reforms, but the future remained unclear."

 byz_anwser.12.t:0 "Trade Partnership with Japan"
 byz_anwser.12.d:0 "       After long and thorough negotiations, Japan gave a positive response to Romea’s proposal to revise trade agreements. The Japanese side expressed readiness to make significant concessions to achieve equal and fair conditions for both parties. This marks an important stage in the development of trade and economic relations between the two countries.\n       The new agreement provides for the establishment of balanced prices for key goods, ensuring fair competition and preventing trade imbalances. Additionally, both sides agreed to create quality control mechanisms, which will increase consumer trust and improve the reputation of products in international markets.\n       Japan also expressed its intention to promote infrastructure development in the region, which will positively affect logistics and accelerate the turnover of goods. In turn, Romea confirmed its commitment to protect Japanese interests in Europe, opening new prospects for mutually beneficial cooperation.\n       This step demonstrates the maturity and responsibility of both sides, ready for compromises for the common good. The successful conclusion of the new trade agreement creates a solid foundation for further deepening economic and political ties between Romea and Japan, ensuring stability and prosperity in the region."

 byz_anwser.13.t:0 "Speech of Alexander II"
 byz_anwser.13.d:0 "       We have received news of a scandalous speech by Alexander II in Constantinople before an audience mostly composed of Russian aristocrats who fled during the years 1926-27 and representatives of the Continental Europe Pact. In his speech, Alexander II expressed extreme hostility towards the Decembrist movement and criticized, in front of the gathered European diplomats and officials, his vision of the political and social crisis in Russia, calling to free the country from the yoke of revolutionaries and those 'corrupting morality.'\n       Such a speech portrays Russia as a cruel revolutionary country, placing us on the same level as Napoleon’s France. Such a reputational blow could have very negative consequences for us in the future."
