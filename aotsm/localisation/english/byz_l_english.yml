But almost everyone could say that unlike his father, he strives to learn. However, tragedy left a mark on Zacharias; he became much more serious than before, which allowed him to become the best student again. After a grand ceremony in 1855, he was crowned as the new emperor of the Roman Empire and Emperor of the Eastern lands. Now only Zacharias will choose the empire's direction."

Zacharias was glad to have a brother. However, since Constantin was not the heir prince, his education was overlooked, resulting in less success compared to his brother. While their father was alive, Zacharias spent almost all his time on his brother.\nLife became difficult for Constantin at age 2 when his father Michael XIII died and Zacharias ascended the throne. The new emperor continued to communicate with his brother, but due to many affairs, could not devote enough time to him.\nAt 12, Constantin was sent to the Constantinople Academy to study diplomatic skills. However, his studies went poorly as he was uninterested. By 14, he could have easily dropped out, but his brother's intervention allowed him to continue. Constantin saw this as freedom to do as he pleased. Unfortunately, he neglected important matters and became a burden to his brother.\nEverything changed in 1842 when Zacharias V died, and August did not plan to support Constantin's idle lifestyle. Constantin had to enter politics to retain some power but was quickly recruited by the democratic faction of the senate. After that, Constantin became the prince of the democrats, seen as the end of imperial power."

Initially, the Metaksis family had no plans for Ekaterina, but when the opportunity to marry her to the future emperor appeared, they immediately began preparations.\nFrom childhood, Ekaterina saw that decisions were made for her. Such upbringing should have made her obedient, but it had the opposite effect. By age 8, she began using her aristocratic roots to give orders to servants, but unlike the rest of her family, she was surprisingly restrained.\nBy 16, she was introduced to the future emperor August. Their relationship was difficult from the start, as both were quite free-spirited. At 17, she was forced to marry August. Initially, this annoyed her, but once she realized the doors it opened, she began planning her future.\nAfter becoming empress, she promoted women's rights but was moderate. Her main desire was to reduce the gap between men's and women's rights. By 1849, her relationship with August had normalized, and they could call their marriage happy.

 POLITICS_JULIUS_ROMANUS_DESC:0 "Full name: Julius Romanus.\nDate of birth: September 1, 1786.\nPlace of birth: Gallipoli.\nPosition: Head of the Imperial Guard, Regent of the Romean Empire.\nJulius was raised under Roman traditions even at the end of the 18th century. From birth, he was brought up in harsh conditions. His childhood was extremely tough, with parents creating many trials to make him strong and resilient. This upbringing made him very independent and cold.\nAt 11, he moved with his family to Constantinople and was enrolled in a military academy. After that, he saw his family only a few times. The academy's teaching methods were outdated, noticed by many but rarely criticized. Julius was different; he constantly argued about how education should proceed. This caught the attention of the former head of the Imperial Guard, Flavius, who took Julius as an apprentice at 16.\nThanks to his character, the approach to officer training changed first in Constantinople's academy and then in others across Romea. Many believe that if Julius had been born ten years earlier, the disgrace of 1806 could have been avoided.\nAfter the Coalition Wars, Julius adopted many tactics, from Napoleon's initial strategies to Prussia's tactics at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt. By 1822, he became head of the guard and reformed it into more than just a ceremonial unit. By 1830, the guard was a small army ready to defend the empire and was called to participate in the Mesopotamian War later that year."

 byz.1.t:0 "Troop Entry into Dobrudja"
 byz.1.d:0 "As soon as we broke the backbone of the Bulgarian-Wallachian kingdom, we immediately decided not to stop on Bulgarian lands. We needed more, and that more became Dobrudja.\nNow our valiant soldiers have already succeeded in destroying enemy garrisons on these lands. Seeing how easily our army was able to march again on enemy territory inspired hope that we could quickly reclaim lost lands.\nTalks about where to go next now do not cease. But the answer is obvious: after the Bulgarian-Wallachian barbarians will come the Albanians or Serbs."
 byz.1.a:0 "The ground trembles under the feet of the legions"

 byz.2.t:0 "Restore Religious Values in the Balkans"
 byz.2.d:0 "Over time, they drifted away from us, both towards Catholicism and Orthodoxy. It's time to end this and show them that there can only be one faith."
 byz.2.a:0 "Ave Maria!"

 byz.3.t:0 "Dalmatia"
 byz.3.d:0 "In the times of our rule, Bosnia did not exist, there was only united Dalmatia, so let this name return and be eternal."
 byz.3.a:0 "Bosnia no longer exists."

 byz.4.d:0 "Victory over Austria gave us lost territories, which allowed us to approach Rome."
 byz.4.a:0 "All roads lead to Rome"

 byz.5.t:0 "Purchase of Gibraltar"
 byz.5.d:0 "The Romeans want to buy Gibraltar — the rock that allows them to control the exit from the Mediterranean on par with us. Losing such an important object will clearly be unpleasant, but the threat of war from their side could put an end to our history."
 byz.5.a:0 "Will they ask for more?"
 byz.5.b:0 "Our lands are not for sale"

 byz.6.t:0 "Purchase of Ceuta"
 byz.6.d:0 "The Romeans want to buy the city of Ceuta, which controls the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea. Losing this city will cost us dearly, but it seems we have no right to refuse now, as the consequences would be catastrophic."
 byz.6.a:0 "Only the city and not an inch more"
 byz.6.b:0 "Even if British, our lands are not for sale"

 byz.7.t:0 "Prussia Calls Us to War"
 byz.7.d:0 "Our friends from Germany have once again decided to attack Austria. This time, according to them, it is the final battle, so considering our territorial claims, they decided to invite us.\nOf course, we can refuse, but then we might miss the chance to easily gain lands. We know of Austria's weakness, and the two previous wars showed that Prussia manages well without us. So it is obvious that this invitation is just a formal pretext to offer us lands in exchange for further cooperation."

 byz.9.d:0 "The discussion has been ongoing for several days, caused by the coalition of the Trade and People's factions (Coalition of Democratic Forces), which decided to bring up the question of the emperor's power in the state. They, naturally, advocate for his removal from power and transition to a republic while keeping the titular empire. The Imperial faction, in turn, strongly opposes this idea. The General faction remained neutral until today's session, where restrictions on the emperor were supplemented by restrictions on military power, causing the latter to join the coalition with the Imperial faction. The majority of the senate still supports the coalition of democratic forces, but with a gap of only 5 seats, the floor is given to His Imperial Majesty, and he decides..."
 byz.9.a:0 "... to stand and deliver a speech."
 byz.9.b:0 "... to accept his fate."

 byz.10.d:0 "The Romeans want to increase their influence in one of our regions in exchange for guarantees."
 byz.10.a:0 "Great Deal"
 byz.10.b:0 "We Are Strong Alone"

 byz.11.t:0 "Speech"
 byz.11.d:0 "The emperor slowly rose to the podium and removed the imperial crown. \n\n —\"Honorable senate, I am a citizen of our great country just like each one of you here. And you demand that I relinquish power in such tense times? My father told me how our country suffered during the 'War of the Third Coalition,' how our soldiers died for our ideals, for our future. And now, when tension in Europe grows stronger every day, you want me to simply leave, turning away from my people?\" — said the emperor. \n\n —\"We only demand freedom and justice for all. We are a European country and must develop like everyone else.\" — retorted the head of the People's faction, Alexandros Mavrokordatos. However, the emperor continued his speech, ignoring Alexandros's comments. \n\n —\"But do not hard times require a strong hand to lead the people to victory? Today I speak not as your emperor, but as your compatriot. I want our empire to succeed, not fall as it once could have. If the Great Zacharias had been weak, could he have defeated the Ottomans at Gallipoli? No. And you speak of freedom and justice? Look at Russia, has anything changed there with the monarch's departure? Not at all, life becomes harder every year. And France, which proudly overthrew its monarch, starting a bloody carnage in Europe, is that the freedom and justice you desire? I think not.\" — by the end, the emperor spoke with clear pride and sorrow. \n\n —\"But if we allow your tyranny to happen, will anyone be well? Will not decades of pain, hunger, and wars begin?\" — interrupted the emperor, Alexandros. \n\n —\"I swear to every citizen of our state, I will never be a tyrant! I will become someone our people will be proud of. I swear that our empire will again achieve the successes of Justinian I. I pledge that by 1854 I will begin implementing the first reforms that will allow, as you say, 'to give freedom' to the citizens.\" — In the senate, as they say, a minute of silence hung, during which the emperor placed the crown back on his head and took his seat. \n\n The Imperial and General factions gave applause, which was no surprise, but strangely, even some members of the People's and Trade factions began applauding. This led to..."
 byz.11.a:0 "... the majority now being with us!"

 byz.12.t:0 "Unaccepted Challenge"
 byz.12.d:0 "His Imperial Majesty August II decided not to tempt fate and to make concessions to the senate. This decision will clearly have consequences and likely very severe ones, as the senate lost the loyalty of two factions, causing a split that will be a severe test for the empire."
 byz.12.a:0 "Reformists rejoice, imperialists weep!"

 byz.13.t:0 "The Future of the Italian Peninsula"
 byz.13.d:0 "Italy is again in the hands of the Empire. But the government has no unified position regarding these lands: some propose to annex all of Italy immediately, others suggest taking Rome as a symbol of our power, and a third group proposes not to touch them yet to allow slow integration into our society. The first option will clearly be poorly received by the Italian people, the second is neutral, and the third will please them. But as with any decision, the final say rests with the Emperor."
 byz.13.a:0 "We don't need the Italian Peninsula, we need its lands, so annex them"
 byz.13.b:0 "Take Rome, let the rest integrate slowly"
 byz.13.c:0 "Better to slowly integrate them into the empire"

 byz.14.t:0 "New Capital?"
 byz.14.d:0 "Rome is again part of the Empire; it's time to decide whether to make it the capital. On one hand, the opinion is that the Roman Empire cannot be called Roman without a capital in Rome; on the other hand, Constantine the Great moved the capital to Constantinople, so the city can be a legitimate capital. The old elites ask to keep the capital, but young politicians crave a new one."
 byz.14.a:0 "Rome — the true capital of the Roman Empire!"
 byz.14.b:0 "Constantinople — the true capital of the Roman Empire!"
 byz.14.c:0 "We have a more interesting option..."

 byz.15.t:0 "Letter from Zergius"
 byz.15.d:0 "       Your August Majesty, you have received a letter from your nephew, Duke Zergius Zachareas. He asks you to keep Armenian generals and officers from the Caucasian provincial army in the service of the state within the main Romean army, as they are forced to retire honorably due to the dissolution of the autonomous imperial province of the Caucasus. Duke Zergius fully understands that our army already has too many officers, but he emphasizes in his letter to you that our general staff also needs competent people who understand how to conduct combat in mountainous and foothill terrain."
 byz.15.a:0 "We will gladly accept them into our army"
 byz.15.b:0 "We do not need them"

 byz.16.t:0 "Loyal Turks"
 byz.16.d:0 "My emperor, allow me to congratulate you on the abolition of the Anatolian autonomous province and the beginning of the long-awaited centralization process. The Romean Empire is now stronger than ever, and we will finally be able to easily deal with our rivals! But forgive me for overshadowing such a good event, the Turkish officers are a problem that needs to be solved by you at the moment, my emperor. We cannot allow these infidels to remain unpunished; a conspiracy against you has long been brewing in the heart of Anatolia," said Senator and President of Hellas Ioannis Kapodistrias at the Senate session on the former Anatolian province.\n"In the lands I govern, Turks will live peacefully and practice their religion and speak their language freely," said August II gloomily.\n"Forgive my boldness, lord, but in the future, this may lead to terrible consequences. Turks and other Muslims will continue to destabilize the country, and this may destroy Romea. The integrity of the empire will be at risk," replied the senator to the emperor.\n"Servants, bring boxes of flowers to the hall," the emperor ordered the nearby servants.\n       A few minutes later, the servants brought a table with the most wonderful flowers growing throughout the country into the senate hall.\n       The emperor asked the senator, "What do you say about these flowers, Ioannis?"\n"The riot of colors is striking, lord," Kapodistrias replied.\n"You may take away all but the yellow ones," "And now?" the emperor asked another question.\n"Worse, lord," the senator answered awkwardly.\n"God loves diversity, Ioannis. Otherwise, He would have created only one kind of flower, one kind of bird, and identical people. But look around, we are all very different. This table was beautiful because it had the most diverse flowers. In the lands I govern, regardless of language and faith; Christians, Jews, and of course Muslims must live peacefully and happily like these flowers. The world is diverse — it is a great gift from the Lord. Turkish officers and soldiers, despite the abolition of Anatolia, must continue to serve in the Romean army, but as emperor, I cannot allow the Young Turks to commit their atrocities against my subjects, and therefore the Ministry of Secret Affairs will deal with the Young Turk cells, which will catch and destroy the Young Turks inside the country and beyond its borders.\n        The emperor left the senate building proudly, senators applauded him standing, and Kapodistrias recalled today's lesson taught by the emperor for a long time."
 byz.16.a:0 "The highest will is the law!"
 byz.16.b:0 "Better to disband them..."

 byz.17.t:0 "Invasion of Austria"
 byz.17.d:0 "       It has begun... Our military advisors have long predicted this war, but now Germany has finally decided to finish Austria. And we need to decide what to do with this: on the one hand, we can wait to see how it ends and then decide the fate of the Balkans with the winner, or we can follow Germany's example and simply invade Austria.\n       The first option is risky because if Germany wins, it might not want to satisfy our territorial claims, even though relations between us are friendly.\n     But invasion always entails one thing... Innocent blood on both sides. Therefore, such an act will hardly be approved by many."
 byz.17.a:0 "The Balkans will be ours!"
 byz.17.b:0 "Better to wait for the outcome of this conflict..."

 byz.18.t:0 "Birth of a Daughter"
 byz.18.d:0 "     In the last couple of weeks, August was waiting for news about the condition of his wife Ekaterina; doctors said last month that her delivery could happen any week. When more than five weeks passed, he began to worry, but this day changed everything...\n     The emperor was listening to senators' petitions about improving various regions of the empire when one of the workers from their family hospital approached August.\n— "My Emperor, I have urgent news for you!" — began the visitor.\n     The emperor gestured to the servants and senators to leave them alone, and as soon as the extra ears left the room, August said: — "And what news do you have?"\n— "Your Excellency, you have given birth to a daughter," the hospital worker joyfully reported. — "Also, I was asked to convey that your wife Ekaterina wishes to name the daughter Zoe."\n— "I was afraid this day would never come," August said with a smile. — "I thought I would never see Ekaterina again, but here is such wonderful news."\n— "Forgive my boldness, but..." — the interlocutor spoke cautiously. — "If I were you, I would hurry to my wife as a loving husband and father."\n— "Indeed... In such a situation, state affairs will wait. Especially forgiving those damn senators," the emperor glanced at his interlocutor. — "You say she wants to name her Zoe? I like it.""
 byz.18.a:0 "Zoe is a beautiful name"

 byz.19.t:0 "Opening of the Parthian Consulate"
 byz.19.d:0 "     Although Parthia is more of a buffer state for us, needed to stabilize the land Silk Road. As much as we want, we cannot forget about interaction with it, so the decision to build a consulate was made quite some time ago. And now we finally have a reason to open it and start an official diplomatic mission with Parthia.\n     Of course, opening such a building imposes certain obligations on us, but there is no need to worry too much about this since during the civil war, so much aid was sent that Parthia will be paying off its debts for centuries. But even with this in mind, we will have to play diplomacy, and pulling them into our alliance may help us on the southern borders of the Empire."
 byz.19.a:0 "This will definitely help our relations"

 byz.20.t:0 "Colonial Question of Zimbabwe"
 byz.20.d:0 "The Romeans want us to become their colonial pawn, like our neighbors the Zulus, but they propose to do this peacefully and ensure our integration into their society."
 byz.20.a:0 "Better them than the French or British"
 byz.20.b:0 "Better the French or British than them"

 byz.50.t:0 "Taurida Dream"
 byz.50.d:0 "       Today, debates did not subside at the general staff about the return of our territories. The main question today was about the territories occupied by Russia. Unsurprisingly, such a region was found, namely Taurida (Crimea).\n\n     Now our military command has begun developing a plan to capture this region with as little resource expenditure as possible. According to the initial concept, there should be 2 landings in the Sevastopol area under the command of one of the generals who have proven or will prove themselves in recent years."
 byz.50.a:0 "Let's wish them good luck"

 byz.51.t:0 "First Meeting with Generals"
 byz.51.d:0 "       The start of military exercises gave impetus to reforms of the general staff. Today it will be decided what direction the military command will take in the coming years.\n        At the moment, there are those in military circles who are supporters of the old school of military actions, as well as those inspired by the speeches of our Prussian friends. On one hand, reliance on traditions has protected our way of life all these years, but on the other hand, our disgrace in 1806 proved the weakness of our military doctrine.\n        Bright representatives of the new school advocate radical army reforms. So that our troops can adequately interact with military equipment, also a rejection of defensive tactics and a transition to the trendy German 'blitz.'\n      But the old generals, whose usefulness has been proven over the years, ask us not to destroy what their grandfathers built. They do not deny the need for army reforms but advocate for creating a doctrine of 'stoicism,' which should be based on discipline and the soldier's unyieldingness in battle."
 byz.51.a:0 "No need to radically change what already works"
 byz.51.b:0 "Enough relying on ancestors, we will defend the homeland, not they"

 byz.52.t:0 "Second Meeting with Generals"
 byz.52.d:0 "       The decision to hold large-scale military exercises brought a lot of benefits:\nFirstly, it initiated reforms in the army.\nSecondly, critical weaknesses of the army doctrine were found.\nThirdly, shifts began in the general staff.\nFourthly, we were able to assert our strength to the whole world again.\n\n       Such a state of affairs cannot but please, but we must not rejoice too much in such a fleeting success. We need to seize the opportunity to reform the armies and continue this process. Alas, this time we face a choice between the advice of the new generation or the advice of the old military.\n        The new generation continues to assert that we urgently need to reform the armed forces before our neighbors do. But this time their statements were more formulated and had at least some arguments. First, they want every soldier to be familiarized with the equipment, both ours and that of our neighbors. Then to start training specialists who will service this equipment and operate it. According to them, with this approach, we can catch up with our neighbors in terms of armed forces development.\n     But the old guard remained true to their convictions this time as well. They continue to argue that we should not change anything abruptly and must gradually prepare new personnel. They also expressed a desire to teach soldiers to dig trenches so that a soldier could hide almost in the open field."
 byz.52.a:0 "A trench sounds very tempting"
 byz.52.b:0 "Let's give free rein to new blood"

 byz.53.t:0 "Third Meeting with Generals"
 byz.53.d:0 "       The stage of army reforms has come to an end. Now our army can compete with most European ones, which washes away the disgrace of 1806.\n       But we must not relax because disagreements in the general staff are growing stronger, so it's time to determine who will be its foundation. We have a choice between supporters of the new military movement and those who continue to cling to traditions. Many of our experts believe this conflict was caused by a generational gap between junior and senior officer ranks.\n     Young fighters ask for a fairer system of staff management, where not only experience but also reaction speed and adaptability to the situation will matter. Many officers of the new school are talented, which will allow us to quickly adapt to the situation at the front.\n      In contrast to the young, we have the old fighters. Those officers who knew those who went to Europe back in 1806. On their side is the experience of many minor conflicts, but also knowledge of the empire's bureaucracy, almost better than the military charter. But they have no more significant successes; maybe it's time to give way to the young?"
 byz.53.a:0 "Let the young listen to the elders"
 byz.53.b:0 "Adaptability will clearly help us"

 byz.54.t:0 "Farewell Letter of Anfim IV"
 byz.54.d:0 "       After the last meeting of the patriarchs, our Ecumenical Patriarch Anfim IV decided to resign and leave the post to go to his homeland to spend his old age. After holding a meeting and then a vote, it was decided to allow him to leave the post with the approval of the majority of the patriarchs.\n       Such a situation has happened more than once, so elections for the Ecumenical Patriarch were held the same day. As a result, Herman IV was elected. Many knew him as a person striving to strengthen relations between Christian confessions, as well as supporting the policy of accepting other confessions and religions within the Empire."
 byz.54.a:0 "May he go in peace"

 byz.55.t:0 "Death of the Patriarch"
 byz.55.d:0 "       No one could have expected that our Ecumenical Patriarch Herman IV would suddenly die, but apparently it was His will. Such an event was too unexpected, which required an urgent meeting of the majority of patriarchs to vote for a new Ecumenical Patriarch.\n       After the Patriarchs of Constantinople, Hellas, and Anatolia gathered, they decided to hold the election of the Ecumenical Patriarch without the other members of the assembly. After several hours of discussion, the choice fell on Anfim VI, who was patriarch before Anfim IV."
 byz.55.a:0 "Rest in peace, our Patriarch"

 byz.56.t:0 "Anfim VI Was Deposed"
 byz.56.d:0 "       Every year brings more trials, and the decision of the patriarchs' assembly was to depose Anfim VI in favor of the more characteristic Kirill VII. Although this decision was met negatively, it was final. Anfim VI himself stated that he supports this decision due to recent events, as he is not sure he can remain a beacon of faith.\n       Few could have thought that the Ecumenical Patriarch could be so easily deposed, but recent years have indeed brought many trials. Many lean towards the idea that this is one of them. The main question now is whether Kirill VII will be able to handle the weight of these years as well as Anfim VI did?"
 byz.56.a:0 "We need a decisive Patriarch now"

 byz.57.t:0 "Romea Began Taurida Exercises"
 byz.57.d:0 "       Troubling news comes from the Black Sea. For about three days, the Romean fleet has been conducting maneuvers they call the 'Taurida Exercises.' At first, it seemed that these were just exercises, but today our reconnaissance vessels began noticing that Romean ships increasingly violate neutral waters.\n\n        Also, one cannot ignore the activity of enemy units in the Caucasus, where Romea has begun concentrating huge forces. There are already rumors about the delivery of the first German 'Panzers' on the main roads between Russia and Romea.\n\n     It can no longer be denied that Romea plans to start a war with us under the cover of these exercises. We urgently need to start preparing for the conflict, or we will lose all initiative, and the outcome will not be in our favor!"
 byz.57.a:0 "Time to switch to high alert"

 byz.58.t:0 "Purple Wedding"
 byz.58.d:0 "       Today in Zachareaspolis, at the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Cathedral, a grand wedding ceremony took place between Romean prince Zergius Zachareas and Kristina Loris-Melikyan, daughter of the governor of Georgia and hero of the Mesopotamian War, Mikhail Loris-Melikyan.\n       Representatives of the entire aristocracy of the Romean Empire gathered in Zachareaspolis for this solemn event, led by the Romean imperial family Zachareas; even the outcast Konstantin Zachareas was invited to the wedding.\n       Prince Zergius spared no expense on treats and gifts for the common people, and these days in Zachareaspolis were declared a non-working week, with festivities and folk celebrations throughout the city. The wedding of the Duke of Great Armenia and Cyprus was celebrated not only by Christian Hellenes and Armenians but also by the rural Turkic population in the vicinity of Zachareaspolis.\n       The wedding ceremony followed the canons of the Romean Orthodox Church, and by the imperial family's demand, the bride Kristina Loris-Melikyan had to accept Romean Christianity before the marriage.\n       Before the blessing, two gray doves were released into the church, which perched on the cornice above the heads of the newlyweds and remained there throughout the ceremony. Kristina's brother, Tariel Loris-Melikyan, held the wreath over her, and General Petros Bagratuni over the prince.\n       Although many Hellenic aristocrats believe that this marriage was concluded exclusively for the benefit of the Loris-Melikyan house and the Armenian nobility of the Romean Empire, since until this moment, members of the imperial family never married girls from aristocratic families of the imperial province of the Caucasus, which caused great surprise among the Hellenic aristocracy.\n       But those present at the wedding saw that Kristina Loris-Melikyan and Prince Zergius Zachareas married for love."
 byz.58.a:0 "Let's see how long his second marriage lasts..."
 byz.58.b:0 "Let's congratulate the imperial family!"

 byz.59.t:0 "Imperial Guard"
 byz.59.d:0 "       Created by Emperor Zacharias V, the Imperial Guard in 1823 replaced the outdated and disloyal Varangian Guard after suppressing their rebellion in 1822. The Imperial Guard is an elite unit of the Romean army; candidates for service are selected through the strictest selection.\n       The functions of the Imperial Guard are extensive: besides protecting the head of state and his family, it directly commands the internal and external intelligence services of the Romean Empire, all army gendarmerie and police except the gendarme regiments of the Romean Guard — an elite military unit of the Romean army directly subordinated to the emperor, created on a pan-European model, performing combat parades built in the Prussian manner. The Romean Guard proved its full effectiveness and loyalty during the Mesopotamian War. Between these two organizations, there is a secret struggle for power and the emperor's patronage, and by creating them on such a principle, Emperor Zacharias V destroyed any attempts of power seizure by one of these elite organizations, making his power inviolable to the highest military command of the army."

The senate justifies this decision by saying the country needs a leader until Zacharias grows up.\n       First, the senate decided who could be a candidate for regency. In a short time, three possible candidates were chosen: Ekaterina Metaxis, wife of August II; Konstantin Zachareas, the closest heir to the throne; Julius Romanus, leader of the Imperial Guard.\n       Konstantin is currently the heir to the empire, so appointing him regent sounds like a logical decision. But many consider him a weak politician since he often agrees with senate decisions and almost never tries to challenge them.\n        Ekaterina is a very strong-willed woman, clearly ready to continue the path her husband built all these years. It is also known that she almost always tries to start a discussion on every senate decision.\n        Julius Romanus is probably the least desired person as regent according to the senate. It is obvious to everyone that he will act not in the interests of the estates and old elites, but in the interests of the state. And of course, even as head of the Imperial Guard, he has several times dissolved the senate during votes on various legislative projects that, in his opinion, contradicted the interests of the Empire."

They wait. We will make them shut up; we will destroy these infidels from old men to infants, because if even one Turk survives, he will want revenge.” The estate assistant, coachman Manulyan, seeing the Vrihedd soldiers, immediately understood what was happening and tried to detain the soldiers but was hit on the head with the butt of a Prussian rifle.\n      The soldiers entered the house; the estate was filled with an atmosphere of complete silence and uncertainty. Felix entered the owner's office, where he sat with his wife. Felix stood motionless for several seconds; they only looked at him and waited obediently for what the officer would say, then he drew his saber, cut off the owner's head, and threw it into the hands of his first wife, who loudly sobbed. Meanwhile, the soldiers searched the house for other relatives; they caught a Turk aged 45. The major ordered the soldiers to castrate him. The search continued. One of the Romean soldiers found a 10-year-old boy and stabbed him with a saber. The two brothers of the house owner, instead of resisting the punishers, began to shout that they were going to Cromwland, but the Vrihedd executed them too. When the execution of the men in the estate was over, they gathered their bodies on the street near the main gate and simultaneously drove all the women onto the estate porch. Major Felix ordered not to disturb the owner's first wife and to carry her out sitting in a chair in an unconscious state.\n     Near the road passed a detachment of Romean military gendarmerie; they saw and heard the commotion and rode to the estate. They were already awaited by the Vrihedd soldiers, Lieutenant Colonel of the military gendarmerie Augustin Podolsky, a descendant of Polish emigrants and now an officer of the Romean army. Seeing what the Vrihedd had done, he ordered his men to arrest them, and the Vrihedd to produce their orders. Seeing the inconsistency of Major Felix’s orders, he shouted at him: “By what right do you wear an officer's uniform? Take off the uniform, prisoner Felix.” Felix replied, “I was a major, and now I am a major, and you...” “Do you dare threaten me, prisoner Felix?” he answered, “God forbid, Augustin Voldemarovich, I am only fulfilling the will of our emperor. The emperor appointed me company commander and set the goal to cleanse Anatolia of traitors, and you, Lieutenant Colonel Podolsky, are now preventing me from carrying out the emperor's order.” Podolsky replied;\n“You killed these unfortunate people, I must report this to Constantinople, but for now, you and your men will be under my arrest until the circumstances of what happened are clarified.”"

The regent, interrupting him, said - Will we spare him after they helped the Young Turks kill August II? - The Russians must see how their dictator surrenders and understand the greatness of the Romeans! said the general. - They will accept this reality without him. Attack Rostov at the first stage. - Yes, Regent, said the staff officer. - Continue, Field Marshal - The second stage - our airships will drop bombs on secondary targets, namely Kiev, Kharkiv, Vinnytsia in the west, as well as Stavropol, Astrakhan, Terek in the east. Execution time - 6 hours after the start of the marine landing in Crimea. The third stage - land and sea invasion to the south of Russia for clearing and subsequent occupation of territories. We expect its full capitulation within 4-5 months of war. - What retaliatory measures do we expect, sir Field Marshal? asked the regent. - The strongest resistance of the Russian army will be on the territory of our satellites, replied the field marshal. - Especially in Kuban - there the Russians have built large defensive redoubts and deployed a large land corps, and according to reports from imperial intelligence, they will try to organize offensive actions jointly with local rebel forces. - We assume, sir Regent, that the Russians will resort to suicidal measures. Expect powerful attacks up to Tiflis and Zachareaspolis. - Estimated enemy losses? asked the regent - As a result of bombing attacks, we estimate 15 - 25 thousand deaths, and the land attack will add another 500 - 600 thousand people to this number. - The Russians only have conventional weapons - the casualties will be hundreds of thousands. - And mostly these are residents of the Caucasus, which is an acceptable loss, said one of the generals. - When will you be ready to strike? asked the regent. - By 7 PM tomorrow, regent, replied the field marshal. - Good, tomorrow evening I will read an address to the people of the Romean Empire in the Hagia Sophia Cathedral, and during this speech, the order to attack Russia will be given."

However, appointing a Jewish military advisor will hit the prestige of the traditional Romean nobility, which has long been characterized by antisemitism and xenophobia, causing another surge of discontent among the nobility, but the population of Judea will be inspired by such an appointment. If the Judean government's desire is satisfied, the head of the Jewish Jerusalem bank is ready to allocate free and irrevocable funds to the Romean imperial palace in the amount of 1 million gold Romean Scythats.\nThe second candidate for the position of military advisor at the court is your nephew Zergius Zachareas, your wife Empress Ekaterina insists on returning the relative to the imperial court. However, due to the heavy workload of the prince commanding the Caucasus army, his candidacy for the position of military advisor at the court is unlikely due to the great distance between Zachareaspolis and Constantinople.

The attack plan itself involves an invasion along the entire front line with priority directions such as Skopje, Burgas, Plovdiv. Depriving the enemy of these border cities will leave them no choice but to surrender. But assessing the risks of such a plan, adjustments were made, namely the addition of a landing in Constanța to sow panic in the enemy's rear.\n         The second target will be Serbia. The country itself is agrarian and weak, which should ensure us an easy invasion, but obviously, after the defeat of their neighbor, they will clearly begin to prepare. Therefore, in addition to the invasion along the entire front line, a landing in Podgorica was added.\n        The third target will be Albania. If everything goes according to the original plan, by the time of the invasion they will be surrounded. Thus, they should become our easiest opponent.\n        The fourth target is Bosnia.

The Christian shrine was defended by a detachment of Toros Ozanyan consisting of 40 Armenian militia fighters and 8-10 armed young peasant men from nearby villages. Besides them, the monastery housed priests, 60-70 orphans, their teachers, and auxiliary workers, totaling about 80 people. In just three days of continuous attacks, the Turkish camp suffered over 1,200 killed and wounded. On the 19th day, the Young Turk command offered the besieged terms of capitulation and surrender of the monastery, but Toros Ozanyan, hoping for the swift approach of the Romean army, rejected all Turkish proposals. On the 23rd day, the defending Armenians ran out of ammunition and provisions and decided to leave the monastery, taking all orphans and workers out. They passed through the siege and left in small groups into the mountains. Journalist Lev Schiller describes Toros's actions: '...Toros, dressed in the uniform of a Turkish officer... walked around all the besiegers, speaking to them in excellent Turkish and at the same time showing the retreat path to his people.' The events at the Monastery of the Holy Apostles strengthened Toros's authority and made him a legend among Armenians. 'Toros is not a human being, he is a ghost,' said the Turks after he disappeared. The Kurds believed that when Toros Pasha removed his burka at night, many bullets fell out of it."

 byz.93.d:0 "       The General Staff meeting was not supposed to go beyond the usual, but the unexpected visit of Ensign Dionysus Heleas, who brought the generals documents found during the Kiev operation.\n— "Honorable Generals of the Romean army, I present to you documents that recently arrived from territories liberated from our enemies," the ensign said hurriedly.\n— "Ensigns don’t often work as postmen," Lev Makkela said. "And the address is informal, of course, there is a slip-up, but fortunately you brought interesting things. You’re dismissed."\n       After that, Dionysus left the room, and the generals began to study the documents. At first, there was nothing interesting, but then they came across a charred diary.\n       Day 47\n       At lunch, we drank Caucasian wine and discussed the eternal question: how long will the war last? Vlahos, who lived ten years in Novorossiysk as an engineer-auto mechanic, believed that the war against Russia would reach the limit of the possible and would similarly fizzle out against Germany, at the expense of the English and French. I, on the contrary, argued that the intensity of the war suggests the opposite. After all, uncertainty of the outcome is the worst thing one can imagine.\n       The common forecast that the war will last forever is essentially based on a lack of imagination; it is made by people who see no way out.\n       Detail: Russian prisoners whom Vlahos ordered to be selected from all camps for restoration work: drillers, geologists, local worker-engineers of one fighting unit were used at the station as loaders. There were five hundred of them, of whom three hundred and fifty died on the roadsides. When the remaining were returned, another one hundred and twenty died of exhaustion, so only thirty remained. Evening New Year at headquarters. I again saw that pure joy of the holiday became impossible in these years.\n       Day 59\n       So, General Beybutyan told about the monstrous shameful actions of the British expeditionary corps in Russia during the capture of Kiev. The central street of the city was mentioned again, where the British and the Ukro-Russian garrison brought German and Romean prisoners of war and broadcasted. These are rumors, and I record them as such, but surely mass killings in huge numbers take place. I thought about the wife of the glorious Murad-bey — he was so afraid for her.\n       Looking into individual fates and suspecting the scale of atrocities committed in places of extermination, one feels such suffering of people that one’s hands fall. Disgust seizes me then before the uniforms, epaulets, orders, weapons, whose shine I loved so much. The old knighthood died — wars are waged by destruction technologists.\n       I went outside, where stars twinkled and shots flashed like lightning. Eternal pictures: Ursa Major, Orion, Vega, Pleiades, the Milky Way nebula — what are people and our earthly path before this radiance? What are all our transient sufferings? At midnight, amid the noise of the feast, I remembered dear people to me and vividly felt their greeting reaching me."\n\n       From a diary found near Kiev of an unknown soldier..."

 byz.94.t:0 "War Has Come to Us"
 byz.94.d:0 "       The Great War, like an inexorable storm, has reached the shores of the Romean Empire, drawing it into the bloody embrace of conflict. The inhabitants of the empire, accustomed to relative peace and calm, found themselves face to face with an unprecedented trial. Never before has history known such large-scale battles spanning entire continents and uniting millions of people in deadly combat.\n       The empire's capital, Constantinople, is filled with rumors and news from the fronts. Every morning brings fresh reports of losses and victories, of soldiers' heroism and destroyed cities. Ordinary people, once busy with their daily affairs, now live in constant tension, awaiting what tomorrow will bring.\n       Experts and analysts, gathered in the halls of the Academy, debate possible outcomes of the war. All agree on one thing: the results of this conflict will inevitably change the course of world history. The world will never be the same, and those who survive this slaughter will see a completely different reality.\n       But despite fears and uncertainty, the people of Romea find strength to unite their ranks. Old grievances are forgotten, disagreements set aside. Now every citizen of the empire feels part of a whole, ready to stand in defense of their common homeland. Determination can be read in people's eyes: they will not allow the enemy to destroy what has been built for centuries.\n       In the streets of cities, rallies and meetings take place where people express their support for the army and government. Women and children work in factories producing ammunition and gear. Men volunteer, eager to contribute to the common cause.\n       Romea, facing the greatest threat in its history, shows its resilience and unity. No one knows what tomorrow will bring, but all are sure of one thing: they will do everything possible to protect their country and its future."

 byz.95.t:0 "Heart of Evil"
 byz.95.d:0 "       Throughout the history of our state, enemies have appeared and faded, but some still exist today, causing problems. Therefore, we simply must decide on whom to focus our attention, because if we scatter our forces among them, we face only collapse. Among serious threats, the following stand out:\n\nFrance.\n       Although France did not interfere much in our affairs in the past, first Napoleon wished to change the map of Europe, and then the socialist revolution. All this happened in less than a century, making France a very unreliable partner in the long term. Although their current government observes all agreements, who said it will be so in the future? Therefore, there are fears that France will become our enemy.\n\nRussia\n       After the Decembrists came to power in 1826, there were hopes they would ease tensions, but the policy of Ivan Ivanovich Pushchin put an end to future peaceful coexistence of our states. Now most of Russia's former dynasty is under our care, which may allow us to establish relations in the future. But unfortunately, Russia currently has a government unfriendly to us, so we should expect that they will remain our rivals for a long time.\n\nConfederation of the British Isles\n       Oh Britain, cursed islands. Foggy Albion always attracted, but now corrupt dictators rule there. As soon as the English dared to think about dominance in the ocean, they immediately began interfering in our affairs, seeing us only as competitors and threats to their ambitions. But every year they increasingly forget that we initially tried to resolve this conflict peacefully, and now hopes for friendship between the British Isles and Romea are so faint that only the whisper of revolution in Albion can save the situation."

 byz.96.t:0 "Report from the Fields"
 byz.96.d:0 "       After the initial deployment of the Romean Guard into the regiments, it was expected they would conduct a full analysis of our armed forces. But they exceeded all expectations, as the report was made within the first month, and it was not just a perfunctory document but a full report. Such promptness shows that the decision to introduce the guard was extremely successful and that the guard quickly integrated into many spheres of our armed forces.\n\nLand Forces\n       According to this report, the state of our land forces can be characterized as very promising. Our worst fears were dispelled, as a multilingual army is definitely a problem, but a clever solution and a competent rank system allow not to mix soldiers speaking different languages in the same units, which allows everyone to hear orders in their native language. Yes, this is an obvious burden on the officer corps, which must know both their native language and Latin or Greek.\n\nNaval Forces\n       Also, to the surprise of many, the report contained data on the naval forces. According to this data, the state of our fleet is assessed as satisfactory. There are problems that need to be solved, but there are also successes. Based on preliminary data, it can be said that our fleet is the strongest but is already beginning to become obsolete, which means funding for naval forces should be increased."

 byz.97.d:0 "       After the news of the start of a large war in Europe turned out to be true, many factories and production units of Romea received an order demanding to maximize the production of products needed by the front in the shortest possible time.\n       Many workers perceived such an increase in work norms very negatively, but the second part of the order softened some of the anger. For the state promised to reward all overtime work both with monetary compensation and special privileges.\n       Perhaps the number of those who do not understand why all this is happening is large, but the number of those who realized that this war will not be for some patch of land, but for the survival of the nation is growing. Over the past years, the patriotic spirit has begun to weaken everywhere, but the appearance of such a strong threat to stability and prosperity united not only the Hellenic world of the Empire but also the other half in the form of loyal Muslims."

 byz.98.t:0 "A War That Lasts a Lifetime"
 byz.98.d:0 "       Almost the entire Empire awaited the Senate's speech with an official statement regarding the start of the war, but this event seemed deliberately delayed. Only a week and a half after the first troops were sent to the contact line was the Senate's address to the nation announced.\n       On this day, the entire Empire watched the events in Constantinople; even those living in the most remote parts of the state sat by the radio awaiting this speech. To the surprise of many Constantinople residents, the usually decorated Senate tribune was today adorned only with the Romean coat of arms, and the entire Senate zone was filled with soldiers of the Imperial Guard. Many expected the Senate head Ioannis Kapodistrias to speak, but instead Julius Romanus came out with his retinue.\n— Dear citizens! I want to address you on behalf of the Empire, the Senate, and the imperial House. Due to the onset of wartime, it was decided to temporarily limit the Senate's power to speed up and facilitate decisions related to the front, Julius began. — I understand that now you see not a simple citizen but a soldier. But I want to say that I am like each of you. After this speech, I will go to the front to defend our great state.\n       He paused briefly to look around and then continued; — Emperor August II in 1849 gave a speech promising not to become a tyrant. And I, as one of the leaders of Romea's military triumvirate, want to promise the same. Do not fear that one of the triumvirate members will go to the front, for since the beginning of our Empire's history, every respectable leader was obliged to defend his people and land alongside all other citizens.\n       Dimitrios Voulgaris, standing to Julius's right, approached the tribune.\n— Dear citizens and inhabitants of the Empire. I am Dimitrios Voulgaris, the second leader of the triumvirate, and I will be responsible for preserving humanity within the Empire while our esteemed Julius Romanus defends us at the fronts, Voulgaris said thoughtfully. — Today, the old world system is being rethought. And it is we who must stand at the forefront of the new era. I will not promise that the years of war will be easy, but this is the history of Romea. Overcoming hard times again and again makes us who we are. Therefore, I believe that just as the Ottomans could not capture us in the 14th century, so our enemies today will not be able to bring us to our knees!\n       Many gathered watched Kirill VII, who stood to Julius's left, waiting to hear what the Ecumenical Patriarch would say, and now it was his turn;\n— May God protect each of us. Dear and esteemed citizens, my colleagues in the triumvirate rightly said that hard times await us. And I will not lie, what happened was inevitable because in recent years we began to forget faith, but know that this is not your personal fault. For the root of anti-religious thoughts lies in modern thinkers and philosophers, but I will not blame anyone, Kirill said, looking into the soul of each gathered. Today Romea officially entered the European war, and now only God's will and the wisdom of our leaders will guide us. Although I am only the leader of the Christian spiritual life of the Empire, I cannot help but notice how our Muslim fellow citizens, instead of trying to fight us, decided to unite with us in one impulse. And this means that the Christian-Muslim split in our Empire is becoming less significant. So rejoice, today trials begin, the outcome of which will be the birth of a new world. A world where all are equal, where there is no hunger, where there are no wars."

People, tired of constant hardships and fear, once again believed in a bright future. And when the triumph in the Great War was finally announced, the streets of the cities filled with jubilant crowds. The entire empire celebrated the victory in a single impulse, glorifying the heroes who defended the Motherland.\n       As military actions gradually subsided, workers began to return to their usual lives. They no longer had to spend long hours at the machines, sacrificing health and rest for the needs of the front. Victory was achieved thanks to the joint efforts of soldiers and the civilian population, and now it was time to restore normal life.\n       People returned home, to their families, to peaceful labor. Factories and plants were retooled for the production of civilian goods. Children played again on the streets, and adults enjoyed the opportunity to live without constant fear. The time of recovery began, and every inhabitant of the empire contributed to the country's revival.\n       With each passing day, life became more and more like it was before the war. Hopes for a bright future became reality, and Romea entered a new era full of opportunities and prospects."

Currently, two colonial societies are active in our country, competing for the crown's attention, but the Emperor has already said that neither will receive support, as we have a different plan.\n       The result of the entire meeting was a 10-year plan, namely:\n\n1. By 1872, capture/conquer the entire south of Africa.\n\n2. Continue developing relations in India and by 1872 propose the Marathas to join our trading company.\n\n3. Help the Copts with their territorial claims in North Africa.\n\n4. Finally resolve the fate of the Arab state.\n\n       These priorities were submitted for consideration to the collegiums. And with the emperor's signature on the document, no one doubts that the empire will develop exactly as planned."

 byz.101.d:0 "       The war, like an unceasing fire devouring resources and human lives, put pressure on the economy of the Romean Empire. Those who did not go to the front were forced to work in factories and plants without rest or breaks, providing for the army's needs. News from the factories was not encouraging: more and more workers fell ill and could not cope with the workload. The prolonged war exhausted resources, and the economy began to falter.\n       The first warning signs sounded when factories and plants began to underperform production plans. Workers, driven to exhaustion, could no longer maintain previous work rates. Illness and fatigue took their toll, reducing productivity. The economy, long on the brink, began to fall rapidly.\n       Specialists and economists warned: if the war lasts any longer, the consequences for the economy will be catastrophic. Already there are delays in deliveries and failure to meet plans, but the longer the conflict continues, the worse the situation will become. If urgent measures are not taken, economic collapse is inevitable, and then even victory on the front will not save the country from internal crisis."
