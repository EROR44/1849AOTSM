From the very day of his birth, he was already being trained as a future ruler, but one thing could not be taken away from him from an early age, namely a love for German culture. Therefore, until the age of 12, he was taught by German mentors, but under the strict guidance of his father.\nAt the age of 14, according to old tradition, he was sent to study military affairs. He managed to persuade his father that he would study in Prussia, where he met the royal family. By the age of 16, he had already made a good military career, but due to the fact that he was a prince of a foreign power, he could not achieve great success. The mentors of the future emperor in those years was Ernst von Wrangel, one of the main infantry commanders of the Prussian army.\nIn subsequent years, the emperor moved away from the military craft and went to study at the Constantinople University, but he could not achieve significant success there, like his father in his time. Therefore, by the age of 19, he was kicked out of the 3rd year, but this did not upset him, but rather set him up for a future change in the approach to education in the state.\nAt the end of 42, times of change come. Namely, the death of his father Zacharias V. As soon as the emperor took his post, he immediately began the path of reforms. The very first reforms were the reform of the fleet and the economy, which made it possible to ease the pressure of inflation on the economy in the following years. But the most difficult was 48, when Russia got involved in the Holy Pact between Romea and the Balkans, thereby untying the hands of the military. Looking at his Empire and his capabilities, Augustus awoke a desire to regain what was lost, why does his Empire bear a Hellenic name? Where is that Latin greatness? But as he said in his New Year's speech at the end of 48 "La strada per Roma è aperta"."

But almost everyone could say that, unlike his father, he tries to learn. But the tragedy left its mark on Zacharias, he became much more serious than he was before, which allowed him to become the best student again. After a magnificent ceremony in 1855, he was crowned as the new emperor of the Roman Empire, as well as the Emperor of the Eastern Lands. Now only Zacharias will choose the direction of the empire."

 POLITICS_CONSTANTIN_ZAHAREAS_REGENT_DESC:0 "Full name: Constantin Zahareas.\nDate of birth: December 27, 1818.\nPlace of birth: Constantinople.\nTitle: Prince of the Romean Empire, Regent of the Romean Empire.\nZacharias V's brother was born in 1818 in the Zachareas family hospital. Zacharias himself was glad that he had a brother. However, due to the fact that Constantin was not the crown prince, his education was looked at through his fingers. Because of this, he could not achieve the same success as his brother. But while their father was alive, Zacharias spent almost all his time on his brother.\nLife became difficult for Constantin at the age of 2, when his father Michael XIII died and Zacharias ascended the throne. The new emperor, of course, continued to communicate with his brother, but due to the huge amount of work, he could not devote enough time to him.\nAt the age of 12, Constantin was sent to the Constantinople Academy, where he was taught diplomatic skills. But studying was weak, he was not interested in it. By the age of 14, he could easily fly out of the academy, but the intervention of his brother in this process allowed him to continue his studies. However, Constantin saw in this more that he can now do what he wants. And unfortunately for many, he finally gave up on all important matters and became a parasite on his brother.\nBut everything changed in 1842, when Zacharias V dies and Augustus does not plan to sponsor Constantin's idle lifestyle. After that, Constantin had to go into politics in order to retain at least some power. But there he was quickly recruited by representatives of the democratic part of the senate. And after that, Constantin became the prince of the democrats, the one in whom they see the end of the emperor's power."

Initially, the Metaxis family had no plans for Ekaterina, but as soon as the opportunity was noticed to marry her off to the future emperor, they immediately began to prepare for this.\nFrom childhood, Ekaterina saw only how everyone decided for her. Ideally, such training and attitude should have raised an obedient girl in her, but it had the opposite effect. Already at the age of 8, she began to use her aristocratic roots and give servants certain tasks, but unlike the rest of the family, she was surprisingly restrained in her tasks.\nAt the age of about 16, she was already introduced to the future Emperor Augustus. From the very first meeting, their relationship did not work out, because they were both quite free persons. But at 17, she was left with no choice and forced to marry Augustus. At first, this annoyed her very much, but as soon as she realized what doors had opened before her, she immediately began to make plans for her future.\nAfter obtaining the title of Empress, she began to promote women's rights, but she was quite restrained. His main desire was to reduce the gap in rights between men and women. By 1849, the relationship between her and Augustus had already normalized and together they could already call the marriage quite happy. But the main task of the Empress now is the education of her son."
 POLITICS_JULIUS_ROMANUS_DESC:0 "Full name: Julius Romanus.\nDate of birth: September 1, 1786.\nPlace of birth: Callipolis.\nPosition: Head of the Imperial Guard, Regent of the Romean Empire.\nIn Julius' family, even at the end of the 18th century, Roman customs prevailed. Therefore, as soon as he was born, he immediately began to be brought up in harsh conditions. His childhood was extremely difficult, his parents tried to create as many trials as possible in his life in order to raise him strong and resilient. Such training made him an extremely independent and cold personality.\nStarting from the age of 11, he moved with his family to Constantinople, where he was sent to a military academy. After that, he saw his family only a couple of times. Training at the academy took place in an extremely outdated format, which many noticed, but few said that something was wrong. But Julius did not tolerate, like the rest, he constantly argued about how the learning process should take place. This could not be ignored by the former head of the Imperial Guard Flavius, who by the age of 16 took Julius to apprentice in the guard.\nThanks to his character, first at the academy of Constantinople, and then in all other academies in Romei, they began to change the approach to training officers. Many believe that if Julius had been born ten years earlier, the shame of 1806 could have been avoided.\nAfter the Coalition Wars, Julius took many tactics into service, starting with Napoleon's original tactics, ending with Prussia's tactics at the Battle of Auerstedt. By 1822, Julius took the post of head of the guard. And he reformed it into something more than just parade troops. By the beginning of 1830, the guard was a small army that was ready to defend the empire. And closer to the end of the year, the guard was called to participate in the Mesopotamian War."
