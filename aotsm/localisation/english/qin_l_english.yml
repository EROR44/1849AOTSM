 POLITICS_AISIN_GIORO_MIANNING_DESC:0 "Full Name: Aisin Gioro Minning\nDate of Birth: September 16, 1782\nPlace of Birth: Forbidden City, Peking, Qing Empire\n\nAs the second son of Emperor Jiaqing and a concubine from the Liu clan, Minning received a Confucian education encompassing philosophy, calligraphy, and military disciplines. His discipline and prudence made him the preferred candidate for the throne, and in 1820, following his father’s death, he ascended to the throne under the reign title 'Daoguang' ('Bright Path').\n\nDaoguang’s reign coincided with intensifying European expansion, which threatened the Qing’s trade relations with the Roman Empire. To protect the economy, he supported a system that restricted trade to the port of Guangzhou and granted a monopoly to Chinese merchants. However, the rise of tea production in Ceylon and India by European companies, particularly the British and Dutch East India Companies, led to an outflow of silver. Daoguang tasked Lin Zexu with restricting tea trade, allowing it only with the Roman East India Company, which sparked conflict.\n\nIn 1840, the First Tea War began after Lin Zexu confiscated tea shipments intended for the Netherlands. The Qing navy, with its wooden junks, and poorly armed troops could not withstand modern European forces. The defeat in 1842 culminated in the Treaty of Nanking, which opened five ports—Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo, and Shanghai—to European trade, ceded Hong Kong to the Dutch, and obligated the Qing to pay reparations. This treaty exposed the empire’s weaknesses and triggered popular unrest.\n\nThe First Sino-Japanese War (1843–1845) dealt another blow. Japan, seeking influence in Korea, seized two Chinese ports, including Lüshun. The weakened Qing army suffered defeat, forcing Daoguang to make peace in 1845. Attempts at reform, including the 'Hundred Days of Reform' in 1848, failed due to..."

 qin_political_event.1.t:0 "Council in the Forbidden City"
 qin_political_event.1.d:0 "      The sun dipped behind the walls of the Forbidden City, casting a faint glow on the tiled roofs. In the throne room, where the air was thick with the scent of incense, senior ministers gathered. Emperor Daoguang sat in his place, clad in a robe trimmed with silver. His face was pale, his eyes weary but piercing.\n\n      Nergingga, tall and stern, stood foremost among the advisors. His pride was evident even in his bow—sharp, without excessive theatrics. Beside him was Li Wen’an, an official who had already proven himself as someone who saw beyond the words of decrees.\n      — 'We fight bandits and theft, trying every means to support the people,' the emperor’s voice rang out, dry but still commanding. — 'Why is the populace still discontent?' \n\n      Silence. Only the breathing of the eunuchs at the doors and the faint whisper of the wind outside.\n      — 'Your Majesty,' Nergingga began, kneeling, — 'corruption is not a disease but a part of the empire’s body. People pay for every justice, and foreigners take what they want. We can do nothing against them—their merchants live by their own rules. All because of humiliating treaties.'\n\n      Li Wen’an remained silent, but his eyes betrayed tension. He knew: if he didn’t speak now, the moment would be lost.\n      — 'In the southern provinces, a sect called the "True God" has emerged,' he said cautiously. — 'They claim the Mandate of Heaven is lost. But it’s not just them causing concern: in Peking, the influence of Shintoist preachers is already noticeable. They speak of gods interfering in the fates of emperors and rituals binding people to the forces of nature. Many residents are listening to them.'\n\n      The emperor frowned, his gaze hardening.\n      — 'This violates the principle of harmony between heaven and earth!' he said, not hiding his frustration. — 'But if we start persecuting everyone who speaks of other beliefs, it will only strengthen their influence. Other measures are needed.'\n\n      Nergingga raised his head, his voice confident:\n      — 'We must ban all foreign beliefs. Let them know: in the Qing Empire, only Confucius and Buddha are revered.'\n\n      Li Wen’an cleared his throat before speaking:\n      — 'But, Your Majesty, if we ban sects, discontent will only grow. And if the ban extends to Christianity and Shintoism, it will lead to conflicts with Europeans and Japanese. It’s better to use old methods: bribe the leaders, divide them, make them fight among themselves.'\n\n      In the shadows, by a pillar, the eunuch Jialiang closely followed the conversation. He knew: the empire already had Christian churches and places where people prayed to Japanese kami. Yet foreign religions remained outside the Forbidden City—no courtier dared mention them aloud. For now.\n\n      Daoguang slowly rose from the throne, leaning on his staff. His face grew even wearier.\n      — 'I must think,' he said quietly but firmly. — 'These matters... are too complex for one day. Leave.'\n\n      The ministers bowed to the floor, not daring to object. Eunuchs stepped forward to open the doors, and cold night air rushed into the hall.\n\n      When the last footsteps faded beyond the door, the emperor was left alone. He slowly sank onto the cushions, his eyes fixed on the carved dragon on the ceiling—a symbol of power that now seemed as fragile as paper.\n      — 'Think...' he whispered, his voice devoid of confidence or anger. Only weariness."
 qin_political_event.1.a:0 "Shadows gather over the empire..."

 qin_political_event.2.t:0 "Reflections by the Fire"
 qin_political_event.2.d:0 "      Night fell over the Forbidden City, heavy as a silk curtain. In his chambers of carved wood, draped with thick woolen carpets, Emperor Daoguang sat alone. His face, worn by illness, reflected the shadows of past and future. Before him, on a bronze brazier, embers burned low, spreading the scent of incense and ash. In his hand, he held a yellow scroll—a report of uprisings in Hunan.\n\n      'Peasants rob officials, and officials rob peasants. Europeans and Japanese take what they want without truly paying. Sects whisper of a lost Mandate of Heaven...' he thought, staring into the fire.\n\n      'Yizhu is gentle as an autumn breeze. He knows how to listen, but can he hold the empire together if the rebellion spreads beyond the southern provinces?'\n\n      'Yixin is a warrior, like a sword in its sheath. But his sword has long rested in the hands of those who whisper, "Why isn’t Yixin the heir?"'\n\n      'Yixuan… A child. Only ten. Yet many courtiers say his name is like a flame in the dark. But what then of the empire?'\n\n      The silence was broken by the creak of a door. Jialiang, the senior eunuch, entered noiselessly, like a shadow. He bowed, kneeling, and spoke in a soft, almost feminine voice:\n\n      — 'Your Majesty, may I speak?'\n\n      Daoguang didn’t answer immediately. He slowly rolled up the scroll, placed it on the table, and then nodded.\n\n      — 'Speak.'\n\n      — 'Your Majesty, there is whispering in Peking. They say your son Yizhu cannot weather the storm. They say Yixin is too dangerous for the throne. And Yixuan...' (a pause) 'He’s still a child, but his name is like a flame in the dark.'\n\n      The emperor frowned.\n\n      — 'Are you saying a child can hold the empire?'\n\n      Jialiang gave a faint smile, hiding it in the folds of his silk robes.\n\n      — 'Your Majesty, sometimes a child is the best shield. While he is young, his name does not frighten but unites. And those who stand behind him...' (another pause) '...they will ensure stability.'\n\n      — 'You mean those who stand behind him?' Daoguang’s voice was quiet but piercing.\n\n      — 'I mean those who see the empire as a temple: if the stones do not hold together, the roof will collapse.'\n\n      Daoguang stood, leaning on his staff. His gaze fell on the dragon carved on the wall—a symbol of unity, strength, and solitude.\n\n      — 'You speak like a sage but act like a spider weaving a web.'\n\n      Jialiang bowed lower:\n\n      — 'Your Majesty, if you reject Yixuan, whom will you entrust with the throne? Yizhu? But he is too gentle. Yixin? But his warriors already whisper of a new order. And the empire... the empire does not tolerate weakness.'\n\n      — 'You fear a war within the family?' the emperor asked.\n\n      — 'I fear a war within the empire,' the eunuch replied softly.\n\n      A long silence. The fire in the brazier died, leaving only glowing embers.\n\n      — 'Jialiang, go,' Daoguang finally said. — 'I need to think.'\n\n      The eunuch retreated backward, vanishing like a ghost.\n\n      The emperor remained alone. His hands, gripping the staff, trembled. He thought of each son, each advisor, each decree he had written...\n\n      The wind outside grew stronger."

 qin_political_event.3.t:0 "The Emperor’s Sons"
 qin_political_event.3.d:0 "      In the Forbidden City, every step, every glance, every word around the throne becomes part of an intrigue. Emperor Daoguang, feeling the approach of his end, must balance tradition, strength, and the possibility of compromise. Before him are three sons, three paths, three fates that will decide the future of the Qing.\n\n      Yizhu, the eldest son, embodies continuity. His education and gentleness make him the natural candidate. Confucian officials see him as a pillar of order, but they fear his kindness could turn to weakness in the face of rebellions and foreigners. His entourage is already dividing power, turning the heir into a symbol behind which others’ ambitions hide.\n\n      Yixin is a warrior to his core. His reforms in the Forbidden City’s garrison inspire officers, but the army beyond the walls weakens. Peasants flee from recruiters, commanders steal from the treasury. His strength is frightening: supporters whisper that he has long been worthy of the throne. But even his allies know—strength can save the empire or destroy it if the direction is unclear.\n\n      Yixuan, a ten-year-old child, does not yet know his name has become a key to regency. Zhuanshun, his mother, and Su Shun see him as a 'neutral choice.' Behind him stand eunuchs and part of the aristocracy, but their eyes burn not with childish innocence but with calculated coldness. The regency, unspoken but contemplated, could be salvation or the beginning of the end.\n\n      Three sons, three paths, three factions pulling the strings. Yizhu is legitimacy, but his gentleness raises concerns. Yixin is a sword ready to defend, but a sword can wound its wielder. Yixuan is a child behind whom adult games are played. There is no unity in the palace: eunuchs whisper with officials, officials watch the military, and the military awaits a signal. Emperor Daoguang knows: his decision will not only choose an heir but test the very empire."
