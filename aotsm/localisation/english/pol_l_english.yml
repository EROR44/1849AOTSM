We understand that this appeal may raise questions about possible benefits from such cooperation. In this context, we are ready to renounce all claims to your lands and conclude an agreement on industrial and economic cooperation that will be mutually beneficial for both parties.\n\n       Furthermore, we commit to joining your alliance and actively supporting you in all your endeavors. We believe that working together for the benefit of both sides will create a solid foundation for future prosperity. The Polish people strive for freedom and are ready to do everything possible to achieve this goal, and we hope for your support in this important matter.
