 fren.1.t:0 "Assassination Attempt on the Head of Government"
 fren.1.d:0 "Today, the head of the French government, Charles Lagrange, became the victim of a terrorist attack. He was seriously wounded by a shot from one of the reactionaries who broke into the French parliament today.\nThe condition of the nation's leader remains unknown, but rumors are circulating that he died shortly after arriving at the hospital..."
 fren.1.a:0 "Charles Lagrange survived the assassination attempt."
 fren.1.b:0 "Charles Lagrange died in the hospital..."

 fren.2.t:0 "Emergency Government Session"
 fren.2.d:0 "After the recent assassination attempt on Charles Lagrange, even the most short-sighted politicians have realized that the crisis erupting in the country is rapidly escalating. Urgent measures must be taken to slow the escalation of the conflict, and in the future, to completely eliminate the possibility of further problems.\nWill the aging politician be able to keep the situation under control, or is it time to give new forces a chance to prove themselves?"
 fren.2.a:0 "Charles Lagrange remains head of government!"
 fren.2.b:0 "Charles Lagrange resigns..."

 fren.3.t:0 "Reform Plan"
 fren.3.d:0 "By decree of a special commission under the French government, it was decided to carry out a total depoliticization of the army, as well as to reorganize a number of other major socio-political areas. Most so-called government commissioners agreed that the main cause of the crisis in the country is the army, stuck in politics and failing to fulfill its primary duties. Most appointees also agreed that many sectors of the country could now use state support."
 fren.3.a:0 "Ambitious plans..."

 fren.4.t:0 "The Army Situation"
 fren.4.d:0 "The French army is not in the best condition today. Officers think only about politics, and most of the rank and file spend their pay in various establishments. The current formations of the army, especially those stationed in major cities, can be considered essentially unfit for combat. While discipline and some organization are present farther from the cities, in urban units this is hardly the case!"
 fren.4.a:0 "A dire situation!"

 fren.5.t:0 "Dialogue with Industrialists"
 fren.5.d:0 "It is important for the government to build relations with the middle class, as its main support."
 fren.5.a:0 "Excellent!"

 fren.6.t:0 "Government Reshuffle"
 fren.6.d:0 "Today's political crisis was caused by the general disunity and bureaucratization of France's political apparatus. To fully overcome its consequences, it must be fundamentally renewed. It is now necessary to get rid of unnecessary bureaucracy, as well as the ineffective officials who create it."
 fren.6.a:0 "Down with the bureaucrats!"

 fren.7.t:0 "Dialogue with the Opposition"
 fren.7.d:0 "The country's opposition tends to stir up reactionary sentiments. In the current situation, excessive growth of such sentiments could lead to major problems in the future. We should smooth relations with several parties and their leaders, thereby reducing their reactionariness."
 fren.7.a:0 "Politics is a delicate matter."

 fren.8.t:0 "Speech to the Nation"
 fren.8.d:0 "Speech to the Nation"
 fren.8.a:0 "Gloire À La France!"

 fren.9.t:0 "Demonstration Exercises"
 fren.9.d:0 "The French army has not taken direct part in military conflicts for over two decades. As a result, the combat readiness of most army units is highly questionable. Additionally, the dominance of the officer corps in politics does not have a positive effect on French units, both at home and abroad. The current command and officers increasingly seek to gain political influence in all circles of French society. The longer this continues, the more serious problems it may cause."
 fren.9.a:0 "Let's show the officers what their real role is!"

 fren.10.t:0 "Stimulating Economic Growth"
 fren.10.d:0 "The current economic situation in the country is becoming quite strange. The country's GDP is growing, new industries are opening, and trade is improving. However, compared to the economies of other major countries like Prussia or, even more so, the Roman Empire, it becomes clear that without stimulating grants and support, France's economic lag will increase every year!"
 fren.10.a:0 "A lot of work lies ahead."

 fren.11.t:0 "Invasion of Algeria"
 fren.11.d:0 "The situation with piracy off the coast of Algeria has reached alarming levels and requires our intervention. We must establish control over the country's main port cities to cut off the threat to international trade."

 fren.12.t:0 "Landing at Annaba"
 fren.12.d:0 "Today, a group of our troops successfully landed in northeastern Algeria. They managed to secure a sufficiently large bridgehead to deploy the main regiments on land and supply them."
 fren.12.a:0 "Let's see how this venture turns out..."

 fren.13.t:0 "Lessons from the Algerian Campaign"
 fren.13.d:0 "The main outcome of military operations in the Algerian region was the identification of several new problems in the French army. The outdated supply system, as well as the general unpreparedness of the troops to operate in difficult terrain, led to significant difficulties in the early stages of the campaign."
 fren.13.a:0 "Problems identified, now to fix them..."
 
 fren.14.t:0 "Claims on Alsace and Lorraine"
 fren.14.d:0 "In an address to the French living in Alsace and Lorraine, [From.GetLeader] declares: the state of [From.GetName] considers itself to have a legitimate claim to this region.\n\nThe official statement supports these claims and clearly makes it known that [From.GetName] will take these lands by force if necessary."
 fren.14.a:0 "We will reclaim our lands!"

 fren.15.t:0 "British Embargo"

 fren.20.t:0 "Louis Napoleon - New Head of Government"
 fren.20.d:0 "Louis Napoleon, a representative of one of the most reactionary segments of society, namely the army, won the general elections. Upon becoming the new head of government, he declared that what happened to Charles Lagrange is unacceptable and that he will take measures to find and punish those responsible for his death as soon as possible."
 fren.20.a:0 "Long live the new head of government!"

 fren.21.t:0 "Elections of [GetYear]"
 fren.21.d:0 "The day of the election for the new head of the French government has arrived. After the tragic death of Charles Lagrange, the nation is in turmoil; however, halting the country's political life would be tantamount to destroying French statehood...\n\nThe main candidates and rivals for the post are: Louis Blanc - representative of the 'Cordeliers' party, Michel Chevalier - representative of the country's main democratic force, the 'Republican Union' party, Henri Charles de Artois - candidate from the 'Loyalists' party, and Louis Napoleon - candidate from the 'Party of Order'.

 fren.24.a:0 ""

 fren.25.t:0 "Charles Lagrange Remains Head of Government"
 fren.25.d:0 "Despite physical weakness, Charles Lagrange firmly stands on the political foundation of France. Today, the politician stated that, contrary to rumors, there can be no talk of his resignation: 'Now that the country is in crisis, the slightest mistake could lead to a very sad outcome. I cannot resign and let everything fall apart!'"
 fren.25.a:0 "Lagrange will not be broken!"

 fren.31.d:0 "After the conclusion of the Algerian campaign, interest among both politicians and French citizens in African lands has greatly increased.
