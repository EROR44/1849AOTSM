 AZT_Montesuma_IV_t:0 "Montezuma IV"
 POLITICS_MONTESUMA_IV_DESC:0 "Full name: Montezuma IV Acamapichtli \nDate of Birth: December 3, 1818 \n\nBorn in the Aztec Empire. Since the country did not make proper efforts towards westernization, Icóchtli decided to attract French emigrants who fled from the new government of France in 1805, the most famous of whom was Count de Langeron, to rectify this situation.\n\nThus, the prince began studying French with this count at the age of 7 to receive a good education by European standards. By the age of 18, Montezuma was able to graduate with honors in universal history (taught by Prince Condé) and native history (taught by his father). Despite his successes, the heir prince did not intend to stop there and therefore decided to enroll in a Paris university, which the emperor strongly encouraged by providing funding for such an initiative.\n\nIn Paris, Montezuma IV primarily studied military craft, Latin, and mathematics; however, after the death of his older brother from a cholera epidemic in 1842, he was forced to return to his homeland. Then, in 1845, Emperor Icóchtli himself died, so Montezuma was crowned as Emperor of the Aztecs Montezuma IV."
