 history.1.d:0 "The turning point for the history of the Balkans, and the world in general, was the failure of the Turkish expansion over the Bosporus and the Dardanelles. A weakened and ruined Byzantium was able to outlast its adversary and preserve peace in the Balkans for posterity.\n\nDue to the preservation of the "Crystal Empire", the trade between Europe and Asia was not interrupted and the turnover between the states of the two regions, not only did not diminish, but in many ways increased. Because of this, arguments about the need to find a route to India through the West of Columbus crumbled to dust, and Christopher himself, for the rest of his life in 1514, tried to obtain consent to pay for the expedition, ranging from the Castilian, Aragonese and Portuguese, passing English and French, ending even the Norwegian kings and the Doge of Venice.\n\nThe era of great maritime exploration begins in the 1520s, when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama attempted to sail Africa from the south and find an alternative route to India. His expedition from Lisbon began in 1519 and already in 1821 he sailed to India and the city of Calicut, returning back to Portugal in 1523 with the evidence of spices. Gama's incredible success was able to inspire many Portuguese navigators to the feat and repeat his journey. In the twenties the first factories on the African coast began to appear, the first of which was the one at the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nIn the years that followed, other major European countries joined in the trade and exploration of the lands along the sea route around Africa. Spain, with the expeditions of Bartolomé Ferro and Thomas de Barlang, as well as Britain and France with smaller expeditions. Colonization of Africa made no sense, so many factories sprang up on the west, south, and east coasts."

 history.2.d:0 "In 1553 the British by mistake sailed into the mouth of the Dvina River, where Arkhangelsk is now located, where they were welcomed, and after being received by the Russian tsar. In 1554 the Russo-English trade treaties were concluded, and in 1555 the Moscow Company was founded, Russia became an important trading ally for England, as did England for Moscow.\n\nEurope entered the 16th century with a festering religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics, which ended in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia, confirming the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire and equalizing Catholics and Protestants.\n\nActive Portuguese expeditions in the Indian Ocean in 1542 made it possible to sail to Japan in 1542 and in 1580 began active trade with the Japanese Shoguns; in 1600 active trade with China was initiated, and the total flow of goods from China and Japan across the Indian Ocean around Africa was called the "Maritime Silk Road".\n\nIn 1640 the English Revolution began, which ended in 1653 with the establishment of Cromwell's protectorate. In essence, a dictatorship was established that brought order to the country and subjugated Scotland and Ireland, thereby forming the Confederation of the British Isles.\n\nFurther colonization in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries allowed navigators in 1762 to discover and establish the colony of Hawaii, and in 1787 the east coast of Cromwell and later the Amazon. From this point on, active exploration of the lands of the "New World" begins."

 history.3.t:0 "History of Prussia"
 history.3.d:0 "The history of Prussia begins in 1657, when under the Treaty of Wielawsko-Bygdoszcz, the state officially became independent of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After these events, the Electorate of Prussia tried to begin the process of uniting Germany around Berlin, not Vienna.\nIn 1701, Prussia officially became a kingdom, thus becoming a serious player in the games of central Europe. Throughout the 18th century, the kingdom was rapidly seizing territories around it and consolidating its authority. Also, towards the end of the century work on a new military doctrine was begun, which, in the future, greatly helped Prussia during the wars of Napoleon.\nUnwhen Prussia emerged victorious from the war of the "3rd coalition", it became proud of the laurels of the victor. First the invention of leupoldite, as well as its safe production. Even after victory, German engineers and commanders continued to improve the new doctrine, which in the future would be called "Blitzkrieg". True, already by 1840 the tension in the Central European region began to grow rapidly, so both Prussian and Austrian forces immediately tried to subdue one region or another.\nIn 2 years, it was clear that neither country could achieve serious superiority, because the revolutionary forces were much more organized than the government forces. The outcome of these events was the revolution of 1848, nicknamed the March Revolution, when the Union of German Nations was formed, but, due to the attempted invasion of southern Germany by Austria, it became impossible to create a unified state. The King of Prussia, now emperor of all Germany, constantly demanded that Austria withdraw its troops, but each such attempt was ignored. Already by 1849 Prussia's patience was at an end, and preparations for military action against Austria for domination in the region began.\nIn the meantime, Prussia finally switched to the military track. Now in the minds of every citizen is the idea: to give battle to Austria. All countries that monitor the region can feel the power of the growing military machine, the only question is, will it become dominant or will it collapse like a house of cards?"

 history.4.d:0 "Our history almost came to an end in §G1341§! when a civil war struck our weakened empire, but the appearance of the Jewish military leader Zacharias of the Zachareas dynasty, who in the shortest possible time gathered military and political leaders around him, was able to end the civil war by §G1344§! Because of the rapidity of this event, internal destruction was kept to a minimum, but the dynasty changed again and now Zacharias sat as the new emperor and new hope. \n\nIn §G1346§! the year the Greeks finally concentrated on their chief enemy, the Ottomans. Under the rule of the new emperor, Romea began its consolidation, and his clever mind helped to minimize the effects of the plague of §G1347§!-§G1348§! Romea also succeeded in protecting Europe from the invasion of the Ottomans, who in §G1354§! were never able to gain a foothold in the European region. After the defeat of the Ottoman invasion an agreement was made between the Catholic Church and the Roman Empire, the result of which was the obligatory support of the Catholic states in return for giving up their influence in the Balkans, except in the region of Greece.This support allowed Romea to speed up the strengthening and rebuilding from all past crises. In §G1379§! the emperor dies, causing the course to change from fortification to the idea of regaining lost lands. By the beginning of the §GXV§! century the process of this return began, a process that took a long time, but was crushingly successful. But by §G1434§! year Romea had already received a warning from the Holy See because of an attempted invasion of Bulgaria, which put an end to expansion in the Balkans. By the beginning of §G1457§! a slow period of regaining the Asiatic lands had begun. In this century the Romeo-Russian relations were finally spoiled because of the fact that Muscovy declared itself the protector of all the Orthodox lands. Because of this, both Moscow and Constantinople began the process of reformation of the church. \n§GXVI! century, however, was a revival of Greek culture. Throughout the century Romea sought to strengthen relations with the Papal See and began to talk about overcoming the Schism. During these same years, the world was full of Romanesque scholars and artists, which again made the Roman Empire the center of European culture. The \n§GXVII§! century continued the era of the great conquests of the Roman Empire. §G1640§! was the year of the beginning of the first great reform of education in the Empire. The purpose of the reform was to equalize Latin and Greek throughout the Empire. The Christian world was horrified by the event §G1679§! of the year, when the Pope gave a Catholic sermon in the Cathedral of St. Sophia, and the Ecumenical Patriarch, in turn, a Roman Catholic sermon in the Cathedral of St. Peter.\n§GXVIII§    ! century was the century of enlightenment, when schools and universities began to be built throughout the empire. The emperors of this period sought to provide access to knowledge and culture. Also by the end of the century the lands of Mesopotamia, Judea, and the Coptic revolution in Egypt were conquered. The \n§GXIX! century began with the Napoleonic Wars, as well as the construction of the Byzantine Canal. These events showed the military lag of the Romish army behind the European countries, due to which the strengthening of Romano-Prussian relations was initiated. By 1849 the state of the Empire was extremely good, which put Emperor Augustus II before the choice: to strengthen §0his power§! definitively, or to step aside and transfer the powers to the §Vsensate§!"

 history.5.d:0 "The entry of Prussia into the war of the "3rd coalition" predetermined the defeat of France. Having been defeated at Austerlitz, the French army was forced to retreat, and subsequent battles were just as unsuccessful for Napoleon.  The general collapse of the army's morale and the subsequent coup of the military junta only exacerbated the situation and in the fall of 1805 the war was already raging on French soil. \The war ended badly for the French. Having overthrown the military, the socialist government was forced to sign the humiliating "Peace of Rheims. After losing Alsace and Lorraine and paying huge reparations, France had to deal with the post-war devastation. \n\nIt took a long time to rebuild the country's economy. By 1816, however, the economy had largely recovered. The extraordinary powers of the government, extended all these years, came to an end. On November 9, 1816, Jacques René Hébert announced his resignation. \n\nCyrille Lepage was the first elected head of government. As a candidate of the left-wing liberal party, he won 51.6% of the votes, leaving his rivals no chance to win. Under him, France continued its economic expansion and, for the first time in a long time, began to conduct an independent foreign policy. \n\nIn the 1930s, the country began a rapid growth of production. The country's economy, which had caught up with pre-war figures a few years before, received a sharp acceleration, thanks to trade and in particular the "Faubert Agreement" concluded with a number of countries. It even saved the country from an overproduction crisis later on. \n\nAt the time of 1849, the country was going through a political crisis. The struggle in the last elections between Charles Lagrange and Louis Napoleon resulted in the defeat of the latter. This set a number of precedents that showed the resolute attitude of the militarists. The contradictions between the new head of government and reactionary circles, created a general instability in the country, dividing the French people..."
