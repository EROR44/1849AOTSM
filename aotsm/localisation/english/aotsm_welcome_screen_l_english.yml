 aotsm_common_story_text:0 "\n        A turning point in the history of the Balkans, and indeed the world as a whole, was the failure of Turkish expansion across the Bosporus and Dardanelles. The weakened and devastated Byzantium managed to outlast its opponent and preserve peace in the Balkans for future generations.\n\n        As a result of preserving the 'Crystal Empire', trade between Europe and Asia was not interrupted, and trade turnover between the states of both regions not only did not decrease but largely increased. Because of this, arguments for the necessity of finding a route to India through Columbus's West were shattered, and Christopher spent his life until 1514 trying to obtain consent for funding an expedition, starting from Castilian, Aragonese, and Portuguese, passing by English and French, and even reaching Norwegian kings and Venetian doges.\n\n        The era of great maritime exploration began in the 20s of the 16th century when Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama attempted to sail around Africa from the south to find an alternative route to India. In 1519, his expedition began from Lisbon, and by 1521 he reached India and the city of Calicut, returning to Portugal in 1523 with proof in the form of spices. Gama's incredible success inspired many Portuguese navigators to undertake similar feats. In the 20s, the first factories began appearing on the African coast, the first of which became a factory at Cape of Good Hope.\n\n        In subsequent years, other major European countries joined in trade and exploration of lands along the sea route around Africa. Spain with expeditions by Bartolome Ferro and Tomas de Barlanda, as well as Great Britain and France with smaller expeditions. Colonization of Africa was pointless; therefore, numerous factories emerged on its western, southern, and eastern coasts.\n\n        In 1553, the English mistakenly sailed into the mouth of the Dvina, where Arkhangelsk is now located, where they were warmly welcomed and later accepted by the Russian tsar. In 1554, Russian-English trade agreements were concluded, and in 1555 the Moscow Company was established; Russia became an important trading ally for England just as England was for Moscow.\n\n        By the 16th century, Europe entered into an impending religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics that ended in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia confirming the fragmentation of the Holy Romean Empire and equalizing Catholics and Protestants.\n\n        Active Portuguese expeditions in the Indian Ocean allowed them to reach Japan's shores in 1542 and begin active trade with Japanese shoguns in 1580; in 1600 active trade with China began, leading to a flow of goods from China and Japan through the Indian Ocean around Africa known as the 'Maritime Silk Road'.\n\n        In 1640, the English Revolution began, ending in 1653 with Cromwell's protectorate established. Essentially, a dictatorship was established in the country that restored order while subjugating Scotland and Ireland, thus forming the Confederation of British Isles.\n\n        Further colonization in the 17th and 18th centuries allowed navigators to open and establish a colony in Hawaii in 1762; by 1787 they reached Cromwland's eastern coast and later Amazonia. From this moment begins active exploration of lands in the 'New World'.\n\n"
 
 aotsm_russian_story_1_text:0 "\n        At the end of the 15th century, a conflict began to brew between the Muscovite Tsardom and the Romean Empire. The reasons for the rivalry included a religious conflict between the Russian and Romean Orthodox Churches, as well as a personal conflict between ruling houses. The campaign against Tsargrad, despite early successes, ended with the complete destruction of our troops near Constantinople, leading to a defeat and the removal of symbols of past victories from the walls of Constantinople. From this moment on, Russia and Rome would compete for dominance over the Black Sea and other regions, and Orthodoxy would finally split into Romean and Muscovite branches.\n\n        In July 1652, tensions between Moscow and Constantinople escalated again, this time due to the religious reforms of Moscow Patriarch Nikon, which the Patriarch of Constantinople refused to accept, deeming them heretical. In central lands under Alexei Mikhailovich, serfdom was firmly established. The country experienced frequent uprisings. The beginning of Alexander I's reign was marked by the War of the Third Coalition against Napoleon Bonaparte's forces. Supporting the coalition, he sent a 120,000-strong expeditionary force under the command of Mikhail Kutuzov. Thanks to his military talent, Russian troops made significant contributions during the Battle of Austerlitz and subsequent battles. However, the French army successfully maintained initiative until the Battle of Jena, where it was decisively defeated by a coalition led by the Prussian army.\n\n        Since the 18th century, Russia strategically required land access to the Great Silk Road; for this reason, Alexander I began a war with the Kazakh Khanate. The attempt at expansion in Central Asia faced resistance from Rome. The commander of Russian forces during the Central Asian campaign was appointed Nikolai Nikolaevich Raevsky. At the start of the campaign in 1820-1821, success was on the side of Russian troops; they managed to occupy central parts of the Kazakh Khanate, but due to strong resistance from local populations as well as rampant corruption within the imperial army, Raevsky's forces exhausted their offensive capacity by spring 1822. This was exploited by Muslim rulers in Central Asia who united against the Russians by signing allied agreements in Tashkent in March 1822. In July 1822, the Russian army was defeated and left Almaty. The defeat in battle led to a disgraceful retreat of the Russian army from Central Asia. As a result of this campaign failure, General Raevsky was executed, and Russian noble society received a severe blow that led to an increase in public discontent.\n\n        In 1816, a secret society called 'Union of Salvation' was created. Two years later it transformed into 'Union of Well-Being', consisting of over 200 members and more resolutely oriented. In 1821, 'Union of Well-Being' announced its self-dissolution; based on it were created 'Northern' and 'Southern Secret Societies', whose leaders had programs for revolutionary transformations. They hoped to seize power through a military coup in the capital with support from provinces.\n\n"
 
 aotsm_russian_story_2_text:0 "\n        After the death of Alexander Pavlovich and the beginning of an interregnum, secret societies decided to act against the new emperor, leading to an open uprising in December 1825. The conspirators decided to take advantage of the complex legal situation surrounding claims to the throne after the emperor's death. On one hand, there was a secret document confirming Konstantin Pavlovich's renunciation of the throne, making Nikolai heir apparent. He did not recognize this document as valid without confirmation from his brother Konstantin after it was read in the Senate.\n\n        On November 27, 1825, citizens swore allegiance to Konstantin and formally a new emperor appeared in Russia. As soon as Konstantin learned that Nikolai refused to accept the throne without confirmation of his abdication, he was forced to go to Petersburg to resolve this unfortunate misunderstanding.\n\n        On December 14th an uprising occurred in the capital due to the fact that the newly crowned emperor had not appeared in Saint Petersburg. The state of uncertainty lasted for a long time.\n\n        By 11 AM on December 14th, 1825 officers-dekabrists (staff captains Alexander Bestuzhev, Mikhail Bestuzhev, Dmitry Shchepin-Rostovsky) led about 800 soldiers from Moscow's Leib Guard regiment onto Senate Square; they were joined by Alexander Yakubovich with sailors and from Izmailovsky regiment; shortly thereafter - a company from Leib Guard Grenadier regiment under Lieutenant Alexander Sutgof; even later - newly appointed dictator Trubetskoy who brought onto square guardsmen's cavalry carriages, Leib Grenadiers and Finland regiment. After several hours of 'silent confrontation', only a few random shots were fired into the air. Unable to bear tension representing government forces Nikolai Pavlovich personally went out onto square to avoid unnecessary casualties and maintain reputation. As a result of meeting with rebels and under pressure from circumstances he signed a document regarding his abdication if he were proclaimed emperor.\n\n        On December 16th Konstantin arrived in Petersburg completely unaware of events in capital. Seeing that city was in hands of dekabrists he decided to confirm his abdication finding no other way out of such situation. With both claimants on throne refusing rule Senate decided to satisfy dekabrists' demands.\n\n        As a result of reforms following December events Russian Empire became a presidential republic where head of state was elected by People's Veche; however no one raised issue about term limits for his powers. Following elections Prince Sergey Petrovich Trubetskoy became first president of renewed state. However due to strong influence from nobility most promised reforms never came to fruition.\n\n        In March 1825 with enormous amendments a unified code of laws for Russian state authored by S.P. Trubetskoy was adopted confirming uncertainty regarding dekabrist policies.\n\n        At beginning of 1830 under pressure from his entourage and due to complex internal situation in country Trubetskoy left office retiring honorably. The new president became Ivan Ivanovich Pushchin who inherited a state filled with numerous problems."

 
 aotsm_prussian_story_text:0 "\n        The history of Prussia begins in 1657 when, under the Treaty of Wehlau-Bromberg, the state officially became independent from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After these events, the Elector of Prussia attempted to initiate the process of unifying Germany around Berlin rather than Vienna.\n\n        In 1701, Prussia officially became a kingdom, thus becoming a serious player in the games of Central Europe. Throughout the 18th century, the Kingdom rapidly expanded its territories and strengthened its authority. By the end of the century, work began on a new military doctrine that would greatly assist Prussia during the wars against Napoleon.\n\n        Emerging victorious from the War of the Third Coalition, Prussia became proud in its laurels. Initially with the inventions of Leypoldite and its safe production. Even after victory, German engineers and commanders continued to improve this new doctrine, which would later be called 'Blitzkrieg'. However, by 1840 tensions in the Central European region began to rise rapidly, leading both Prussian and Austrian forces to attempt to dominate various regions.\n\n        But within two years it became clear that no country could achieve a significant advantage, as revolutionary forces proved to be much more organized than government forces. The outcome of these events was the revolution of 1848, dubbed the March Revolution, when the Union of German Nations was formed; however, due to Austria's attempt to invade southern Germany, creating a unified state became impossible. The Prussian king, now emperor of all Germany, constantly demanded that Austria withdraw its troops; however, each such attempt was ignored. By 1849, Prussia's patience had run out and preparations for military action against Austria for dominance in the region began.\n\n        Now Prussia has completely shifted to a military footing. In every citizen's mind is the idea: to confront Austria. All countries observing the region can feel the strength of the growing military machine; the only question is whether it will become dominant or collapse like a house of cards."

The nine-year-old John V Palaiologos was not crowned, although he was the designated heir and co-ruler, which led to a power vacuum and later to the start of a civil war. Initially, his main opponent was John VI Kantakouzenos; however, during the hostilities, the people began to sympathize with the wise military leader Zacharias Zachareas, who tried to ease the lives of civilians during this difficult time. Zacharias Zachareas decided to unite the zealots, Varlaamites, and Palamites in the following manner: from now on, Palamites could continue practicing their faith, which was encouraged by the military leader, while most of the saved funds were spent on establishing relations with Varlaamites—thus, Zacharias the Great managed to reach a consensus, and according to the Thessalonian Peace Treaty "Christian Peace", persecutions of both Orthodox and Catholics ceased; punishment for violating their rights was death. Over time, his influence grew so much that both claimants to the throne, under pressure from citizens and military forces, renounced their coveted titles; after which the people of Rome proclaimed Zacharias the Great as their new emperor.\n\n                                            The reign of Zacharias I years of life: §21307 - 1379§! years of reign: §21344 - 1379§!\n\n     As a popular elected ruler, Zacharias I Zachareas understood the requests of his subjects; therefore, in the early years of his reign he ensured a complete cessation of wars to restore the economy and trade of the Romean Empire after the Civil War. By early 1346, due to an increasing threat from remnants of the Seljuk Empire, Zacharias the Great began fortifying castles in the Dardanelles region. Despite all measures taken to strengthen fortifications in Dardanelles, fully implementing plans was hindered by an outbreak of "Black Death", which, due to Zacharias I's policy of aiding recovery for Rome's people, was not as deadly as in Western Europe. Zacharias's fears were confirmed when in 1352 Ottoman Sultan Orhan Ghazi declared war on him and began besieging the fortress of Tsimtsi. The siege lasted until early 1354 and ended only due to a minor earthquake that damaged part of the walls; nevertheless, it was a significant blow. Afterward, the Turks attempted an invasion into Greece but their army exhausted from a long siege suffered a crushing defeat at Gallipoli, losing most of their fleet during retreat; however, conditions for Romeans were so dire that they decided to sign a peace treaty under which Turks received all eastern shores of Aegean Sea. Restoring imperial prestige after victory over Turks in 1355 allowed Zacharias to conclude a 'Holy Pact' with the Pope aimed primarily at attracting financial flows for recovering devastated lands and further assistance in battles against Muslim-Turkish invaders in Asia Minor. In return, Romean Empire pledged not to attempt further territorial acquisitions in Europe.\n\n"

His organizational genius along with financial support from Holy See brought prosperity to Romean Empire and fully restored economy of what had once been a decrepit country. Thanks to mediation from Pope Rome Emperor Constantine XI managed to negotiate with Venice and Genoa for purchasing islands they had acquired during Fourth Crusade. Thus Corfu, Crete, and Cyclades were returned. Besides obvious political and territorial benefits from these deals Romeans also gained key trading points that allowed them to monopolize trade with Asia and maintain control over Silk Road.\n\n                                            The reign of Michael IX years of life: §21381 - 1469§! years of reign: §21417 - 1469§!\n\n     The reign of Michael IX is considered one of favorable periods in history of Romean Empire. He initiated military campaigns aimed at reclaiming imperial possessions in Asia Minor; in 1467 he declared war on Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II and defeated his army at the walls of Nicomedia in 1468 thereby permanently eliminating Beylik-Osman as a political force in Asia Minor. In 1468 a crusade against Turkish beyliks in Anatolia was convened. In October 1468 there occurred a general battle between Christian forces led personally by Romean Emperor Michael IX and Sultan Ibrahim II's army near a small settlement called Kalejik. The battle lasted two days with an overnight break. On the third day of fighting Ibrahim II's janissaries realizing that success would favor Christian forces staged an open rebellion and overthrew their sultan presenting his head to Romean Emperor; bewildered by this act Turkish troops surrendered on fourth day laying down arms before Christian forces but Hungarian knights and soldiers mourning Vladislav III's death executed most of them. After victory at Kalejik Christian forces entered Ankara; further advance deep into Asia Minor proceeded very slowly. Nevertheless borders stubbornly moved deeper eastward as Romeans and crusaders defeated Turkic Khanate Ak-Koyunlu capturing its capital Diyarbakir; then at end of 1468 an Armenian uprising against rule by remnants of Karaman Sultan erupted in Adana; in January 1469 King

In this year, what seemed unthinkable happened: the Pope delivered a Catholic sermon in the Cathedral of Saint Sophia, while the Ecumenical Patriarch delivered an Orthodox one in the Cathedral of Saint Peter. This was the first step towards reconciliation between the two branches of one religion.\n\n                                            The reign of Michael X years of life: §21419 - 1500§! years of reign: §21472 - 1500§!\n\n     Michael X took the place of his deceased brother, believing that his predecessor fell victim to a conspiracy rather than a random illness. Obsessed with this idea, the new ruler updated the judicial code, tightening penalties for serious crimes and began persecuting those who disagreed with his policies, considering them potential murderers of his brother. Additionally, he patronized the process of Hellenization in Western Anatolia. But the main challenge for Emperor Michael X was the war with the Russian Tsardom. The Russian Tsardom, declaring that it does not recognize Byzantine emperors from the Zacharias dynasty as heirs to Rome, invaded their territory at the end of 1499. The war began extremely unsuccessfully for the Romean Empire—the Russian army managed to capture maritime border fortresses and began its march on Constantinople. The situation was further complicated by chaos following Emperor Michael's death.\n\n                                            The reign of John V years of life: §21452 - 1527§! years of reign: §21500 - 1527§!\n\n     However, John was able to quickly stabilize the situation and take command of the army, subsequently defeating the advancing forces of Muscovy, forcing the Moscow prince to seek peace. From this moment on, long-standing hostile relations began between the Muscovite Tsardom and the Romean Empire. In 1507, the Senate of Rome was officially revived, and the slogan S.P.Q.R once again adorned government buildings of the empire. Although this decision reduced imperial power, it did not fully change the political course of the state. The main advantage of the Senate was an increase in public trust towards authority. The Senate especially supported Zacharias III, who was remembered as one of the most liberal figures in Romean Empire history.\n\n"

He also made great efforts to restore and reform the Romean army; under him, active rearmament began with standardized models of modern firearms. After completing military reforms, the empire decided to test its strength in Transcaucasia by supporting Christian uprisings in local Turkic territories. During the campaign from 1530 to 1535, all territories in that region returned to imperial control, and Romeans were finally convinced of the effectiveness of their newly equipped troops. In 1535, Ishkhan Zakaryan as tyrant of Armenia and King Laursab Bagrationi of Georgia voluntarily swore allegiance to Greek Basileus Zacharias III; from that moment on Armenia and Georgia became part of the Romean Empire.\n\n                                            The reign of Zacharias IV years of life: §21503 - 1567§! years of reign: §21527 - 1567§!\n\n     In 1585, under Emperor Zacharias IV's leadership, the Romean Empire launched a Great Syrian Campaign against the Mamluk Sultanate with Jerusalem as its primary objective. During this campaign, in battle, the emperor was struck down by an archer from the Mamluk Sultanate and perished after sitting on his throne for less than three years.\n\n                                            The reign of Constantine XII years of life: §21537 - 1591§! years of reign: §21567 - 1591§!\n\n     Under Constantine XII's command, war against Mamluks went quite successfully; however, it took on a protracted nature that exhausted imperial resources after Muslims from Iraq, Syria, and Egypt united against invaders. This led to military actions in the region concluding in 1589 when both warring powers signed a shaky peace treaty. Only lands from Syria were ceded to Rome; however, "the Holy City"—Jerusalem—was not returned to imperial control.\n\n                                               The reign of John VI years of life: §21572 - 1639§! years of reign: §21591 - 1639§!\n\n     Starting from 1601, Romean army successfully engaged in combat against Turkic Khanate Kara-Koyunlu and in inter-river battles; by 1637 they had completely subdued all lands within Mesopotamian basin. On their way back to Aegean shores, buoyed by their success, they attempted a local invasion into Holy Land. Since Muslims embroiled in internal conflicts did not expect an attack from Romean troops, conditions on that territory turned out quite favorable for Constantinople transforming a small raid into a full-scale offensive. In less than two years imperial army managed to capture lands from Beirut to Sinai thus depriving Muslim rulers in Middle East access to Mediterranean Sea.\n\n                                             The reign of Michael XI years of life: §21600 - 1667§! years of reign: §21639 - 1667§!\n\n     In 1640 under Michael XI Zacharias's leadership began first major education reform aimed at making Greek and Latin accessible to everyone within empire; books from other countries were purchased for subsequent translations into these languages. Over subsequent decades scientific foundation strengthened so much that Rome became a universally recognized scientific center. Now all leading scholars around world could not do without knowledge of Romean language.\n\n"

The year 1707 marked the establishment of trading posts in South Africa. From 1709 to 1715, enormous funds were poured into Byzantine India. On May 12, 1710, the Romean Empire, represented by Patriarch Callinicus II Acharnaean, attempted to carry out a religious 'reform' in Armenia and Cilicia, which caused a huge surge of discontent among the authorities of the Romean Empire among almost all Armenians, even among those most pro-imperial. Reformists under Callinicus II also implemented a similar plan with the Georgian and Abkhaz Orthodox churches. While this did not cause major discontent in Georgia, in Armenia this decision triggered a significant wave of anti-Romean uprisings. Partisan groups (haiduces) began to emerge in Armenia, calling themselves 'fidain', fighting for the repeal of the church reform of 1710; until the Nakhichevan incident, Greek administration managed to maintain order in the region through harsh methods. In 1715, the city of Nakhichevan was captured by armed local Turkic askars led by Mahmud Khan. The Romean government, represented by the Caucasian administration, attempted to resolve the issue peacefully and recognize the autonomy of this entity; however, on May 12, Nakhichevan's mayor Arthur Arutyunyan appealed to David-Bek, who at that time was the son of the prince of Syunik and Artsakh. David-Bek had made a brilliant career in the Byzantine army and was known for his military talent. According to an agreement with Arthur Arutyunyan, David-Bek came with militia to Nakhichevan and decided to deal with the Turks by his own methods. Arthur Arutyunyan later acknowledged that this endeavor turned out to be foolish and that David-Bek was unjustly blaming Rome and the basileus for the consequences. Moreover, as it turned out after suppressing the uprising by mountain brothers according to reports from Romean intelligence, David-Bek was already acting as a Russian agent at that time.\n\n                                            The reign of Constantine XV years of life: §21701 - 1781§! years of reign: §21721 - 1781§!\n\n     Since 1746, as the state apparatus ceased to cope with managing its lands, a process of decentralization began in Byzantium. Thus semi-autonomous states I.P. Anatolia and I.P. Caucasus appeared on maps. The Judean and Mesopotamian Federates were also highlighted on maps. These two states belong to the Romean Empire but are formally free. From 1722 to 1725, with support from Mkhitar Sparapet, David-Bek led an armed struggle by Armenians from Syunik and Artsakh against the Romean basileus and his loyal local Turks for some time, which resulted in almost complete expulsion of Qizilbash and Persians from Eastern Armenia.\n\n"
 
 aotsm_byzantium_story_6_text:0 "\n     In 1726–1728, Armenians under David-Bek's leadership fought against Romeans who sought to suppress this uprising. David-Bek and his troops captured one Romean fortress after another. In spring 1725, a large Romean army entered Arran and Ganja and then tightened its grip on Artsakh and Syunik. On the seventh day of unequal battles, David-Bek's warriors unexpectedly attacked their enemy at night after exiting their fortress; panicking, they suffered heavy losses and fled. After a brilliant victory near Alidzor, David-Bek pursued his enemies. The Romeans suffered another heavy blow that summer near Megri where they faced defeat once again. Ultimately, after another three years of civil war forced Romean basileus Constantine XV Zacharias to recognize David-Bek's victory and make concessions to him. On April 8, 1728, Constantine XV and David-Bek signed a peace agreement whereby Rome repealed its church reform in Armenia. By 1730, following the death of David-Bek's successor Mkhitar Sparapet, uprisings in Armenia ceased due to the repeal of church reform.\n\n      Instead of peaceful negotiations that were postponed, David-Bek quickly captured cities, tortured women, and executed numerous civilians—both Turks and Armenians—from small shopkeepers to elderly people and teenagers. David-Bek's actions were condemned by Emperor Constantine XIV Zacharias as war crimes since during this incident Turks showed no aggression and attempted to gain recognition from the Romean Empire. Furthermore, when imperial soldiers arrived in Nakhichevan to restore order, David-Bek refused them entry until Armenians were allowed to worship God according to their rites in their churches again. The emperor striving to end lawlessness and restore legality had no choice but to agree. However, this was a ruse to lure David-Bek into arrest during negotiations with a Romean delegate. On that day after capturing David-Bek arose the Brothers' Movement—a movement for Armenia's liberation from Romean Empire's rule. Initially composed only of loyal officers to David-Bek and militia from his father's estate; over time it began gaining popularity among many Armenians. During David-Bek's imprisonment in Kapan his father—the prince of Syunik and Artsakh—died. After gaining freedom David-Bek returned to Kapan and took his throne. In 1718 David-Bek challenged Thomas Varagoros—a Romean governor of Caucasus—to a duel and killed him. Later he escaped from Erebuni with help from Armen Atabekyan who would be executed later on. David-Bek himself refused to consider killing the governor a crime. That same year he narrowly escaped execution in Shushi where he was brought from Mantsikert where Romean legionaries had set up an ambush. A general Emmanuel Sklyar personally arrived at this small fortified town but execution was thwarted by an attack on it by Turkic bands.

This allowed for the grand project of constructing the 'Byzantine' Suez Canal to begin in 1791, which was intended to connect the Mediterranean and Red Seas.\n\n                                            The reign of Michael XII years of life: §21750 - 1790§! years of reign: §21783 - 1790§!\n\n     By the end of the 18th century, it became evident that forming alliances with other European countries was necessary. This led to the beginning of diplomatic relations between Rome and Prussia. In 1786, a treaty was signed between Russian Empress Catherine II Romeanova and Romean Emperor Michael XII Zacharias, establishing the current official borders of the two empires in the Northern Caucasus, recognized by both Rome and Russia. From this moment on, rivalry between the two empires in the Northern Caucasus shifted from open conflict to a cold phase. In 1787, due to an impending rupture between Russia and Rome, Romean troops stationed in Transcaucasia were withdrawn to a fortified line. The Kabardians ceased hostilities in exchange for the return of arable lands in Pyatigorsk. Additionally, a zemstvo army was established from Ossetians, Ingush, and Kabardians. Realizing that Pyatigorsk would not be returned, the Kabardians left the ranks of Romean troops in 1790. General Potemkin and later General Tekelis conducted expeditions into Circassia, but the situation along the line did not change significantly, and raids by mountain dwellers continued unabated. In 1790, the mountaineers advanced into Kabarda but were defeated by General Germanis at the Battle of Abazinka. In June 1791, the commander of the North Caucasian Corps and head of the Caucasian Line Fokinis stormed against the mountaineers in Anapa, capturing wounded Sheikh Mansur.\n\n                                            The reign of Michael XIII years of life: §21772 - 1820§! years of reign: §21790 - 1820§!\n\n     The change of centuries occurred amidst explosions and clouds of smoke. Europe was embroiled in the War of the Third Coalition. However, the Romean Empire did not participate directly; it limited itself to sending an expeditionary corps of 20 thousand men. The losses among volunteers were horrific at 90%. A devastating blow was dealt to military traditions; thus military circles began to contemplate urgent modernization of the army. Within the Crystal Empire itself, the beginning of the 19th century was anything but calm; amidst rising national sentiments in 1801, the First Turkish Revolution broke out in Anatolia organized by Young Turks. The Byzantine army managed to suppress the uprising only by mid-1805.\n\n"
 
 aotsm_byzantium_story_8_text:0 "\n     At the end of 1805, the Anatolian administration conducted Operation 'Diamond Knife', as a result of which over 120 thousand Turks were deported from Anatolia to Persia, while their former homes were settled by 50 thousand Greeks from Hellas. In connection with these events, Russia and the Confederation of British Isles raised the Muslim question in Rome, which finally soured relations between countries. After defeating France in 1806, Rome began actively calling for investment in building the Byzantine Canal to expedite its opening since the growth of British and Portuguese colonies began threatening its monopoly on Asian goods. This decision allowed for completion of construction by 1820; however, its opening only occurred in 1824 due to lengthy testing.\n\n                                            The reign of Zacharias V years of life: §21802 - 1842§! years of reign: §21820 - 1842§!\n\n     In 1830, an Arab state under the protection of the Confederation of British Isles attacked Romean lands in the Near East, unleashing a terrible and bloody Mesopotamian War that nearly destroyed the Crystal Empire by 1832; however, thanks to diplomatic and material assistance from Prussia's kingdom, Romean troops managed to repel and counterattack while simultaneously reclaiming their lands in the Near East. By 1832 a new education reform began under Senate auspices preparing for a transition from a bilingual to a trilingual system; however this process was frozen due to the outbreak of Mesopotamian War and only resumed after its conclusion in 1836. Zacharias V died in 1842 at age 40 during a horseback ride through the imperial garden due to heart failure.\n\n                                            The reign of Augustus II date of birth §21820§! year, date of ascension to throne §21842§! year\n\n     As soon as Augustus II ascended to the imperial throne he immediately began transforming his country and implementing liberal reforms within the empire. One of his first reforms was an economic reform that alleviated inflationary pressures on the economy in subsequent years; he also slowed down transition from a bilingual system to a trilingual one while moving towards more pragmatic diplomacy. The most tense year was 1848 when Russia intruded into Holy Pact between Rome and Balkans thereby freeing up Romean army's hands. Only time will tell what Rome will become under its new emperor...\n\n     And further history lies in your hands. Will Rome be an empire over which the sun never sets or will it perish as it was destined to do in 1444?\n\n"

 
 aotsm_french_story_text:0 "\n        The entry of Prussia into the War of the Third Coalition predetermined France's defeat. After suffering defeat at the Battle of Jena, the French army was forced to retreat; subsequent battles were also unsuccessful for Napoleon. The overall decline in army morale, along with the dire financial situation of the state, only exacerbated the situation, ultimately leading to the French government being forced to sign a peace treaty with the countries of the Third Coalition in 1806.\n\n        The war ended in defeat for the French. Losing Alsace and Lorraine and paying enormous reparations, France had to deal with post-war devastation.\n\n        The recovery of the country's economy took a considerable amount of time; however, by 1816, the economy had been significantly restored. The extraordinary powers of the government, extended all these years, came to an end. On November 9, 1816, Jacques René Hébert announced his resignation.\n\n        The first elected head of government was Cyril Lepage. As a candidate from the left liberal party, he garnered 51.6% of the votes, leaving his opponents with no chance of victory. Under him, France continued its course towards economic strengthening and began to pursue an independent foreign policy for the first time in a long while.\n\n        In the 1830s, the country experienced rapid industrial growth. The economy, which had caught up with pre-war indicators several years earlier, accelerated thanks to trade and particularly due to the "Fober Agreement" concluded with several countries. This eventually even saved the country from a crisis of overproduction.\n\n        By 1849, the country was experiencing a political crisis. The struggle in the last elections between Charles Lagrange and Louis Napoleon resulted in defeat for the latter. This created a series of precedents that showed a determined stance from militarists. The contradictions between the new head of government and reactionary circles created overall instability in the country, dividing the French people into factions...\n\n"
 
 aotsm_britain_story_text:0 "\n        English history begins to differ from reality in 1553 when several English trading ships mistakenly sailed into the mouth of the Dvina, where Arkhangelsk is located today, where they were warmly welcomed and later accepted by the Russian tsar. The following year, a Russian-English trade treaty was concluded, and in 1555 processes began for establishing the Moscow Company. This laid the foundation for trade relations between two states that would grow into important trading ties in the future.\n\n        The 16th century was also marked by expeditions to Asia initiated by the Portuguese. In 1542 they arrived on Japan's shores and began active trade with the Japanese Empire in 1580; however, trade with Japan was partially halted in 1637 due to an uprising within it. Why were Portuguese trade routes so important? It’s simple: KBO and Portugal were always friends; even after Cromwell came to power, relations continued to strengthen so that any Portuguese and any English trade route became common for both countries.\n\n        The 17th century became pivotal in KBO's new history; in 1640, the 'English Civil War' began, which would lead to England's first republic in 1649 and then to Cromwell's Protectorate in 1653. Once Cromwell firmly established his power, he launched a punitive expedition against Ireland that ended with a crushing defeat of Irish armed forces and incorporation of Ireland into the Confederation. At this time in Europe, a religious conflict ended that ultimately fragmented the Holy Romean Empire and equalized Catholics and Protestants. After these events, Cromwell began devising ways to separate British religion from continental ones, thus starting a transition from Protestantism to Anglicanism.\n\n        Initially, the 18th century was very calm; however, by mid-century Europeans became actively interested in colonialism as they finally discovered what would be called Cromwland or New World. KBO was one of its main colonizers; however by century's end as Napoleon rose in Europe both Austrians joined them establishing colonies in Amazonia and Southern Cromwland.\n\n        The 19th century marked the beginning of KBO's decline as each Lord Protector during this era was remembered as one of the worst throughout Confederation's history. In 1834, Lord Protector's position was assumed by a representative of KBO's liberal movement—William Lamb—who initiated a transition from dictatorship to a more democratic regime. This displeased British elites greatly. Reckless reforms led to an economic collapse that left over 20% of Britons homeless and about 50% unemployed. Due to this there was an attempt to remove Lamb from office; however intervention by Edward Smith-Stanley prevented Parliament from doing so. Currently KBO is facing dire straits starting from Lamb's economic collapse continuing with old guard domination over government and army losing valuable scientific personnel and most sadly outdated military doctrine since after Napoleonic wars Confederation adopted legislation on unchanging tactics and strategies... Will William Lamb who suffered a stroke in 1848 gather new people around him and save KBO or will it fall on his successors... This is a question you must answer.\n\n"
