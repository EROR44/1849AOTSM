 #EVENT
 
 prt_event.1.t:0 "Mass Uprisings"
 prt_event.1.d:0 "Today, mass demonstrations took place in the streets of Lisbon and Porto, which by the end of the day turned into spontaneous riots and clashes with the police. According to reports from observers, the instigators of the conflict were socialist cells, which were later joined by some radical liberals. This situation has become another alarming sign for our government. We need to immediately stabilize the situation in the country, before everything gets out of control."
 prt_event.1.a:0 "Damn them!"

 prt_event.2.t:0 "Reactionary Coup"
 prt_event.2.d:0 "Tonight, a group of generals led by Antonio Jose de Avila entered the Queen's residence to discuss army issues with her. At the same time, loyal garrisons in the largest cities of the country took control of government agencies, radio towers, railways, and ports. In the morning, the citizens of Portugal were informed that Her Majesty has temporarily left the residence due to threats from socialist terrorists and has temporarily transferred all powers to Antonio Jose. It is still unclear how the further events will develop, but judging by the recklessness of the coup, the new power does not intend to be polite with its opponents."
 prt_event.2.a:0 "Forward to the Great Portugal!"

 prt_event.3.t:0 "Mass Uprisings"
 prt_event.3.d:0 "Today, mass demonstrations took place in the streets of Lisbon and Porto, which by the end of the day turned into spontaneous riots and clashes with the police. The demonstrators, consisting mainly of socialists and democrats, were able to significantly destabilize the situation in the country. Now that everyone is aware that the current government is unable to handle its tasks, supporters of new political trends can seize power. The question is only who will be able to do it faster: socialists or liberals?"
 prt_event.3.a:0 "Forward to the new order!"
 
 prt_event.4.t:0 "New Power"
 prt_event.4.d:0 "A coalition of democratic forces led by Antonio Maria de Fontesh proposed a new democratic system to the current government. According to the plan, it would accommodate both progressive liberals and conservative representatives. Such a symbiosis promises to stabilize society at the cost of some influence of the current elites, but considering the risk of losing everything, most members of the government approved the transition to the proposed type of state management. However, this agreement does not provide for the participation of socialists..."
 prt_event.4.a:0 "Democracy will save Portugal!"

 prt_event.5.t:0 "The Real Revolution"
 prt_event.5.d:0 "The leadership of the socialists was furious. Not only did the pathetic liberals outpace them by just one step, but they also dared to betray their comrades from the rallies and underground meetings by not including them in the new system of state management. The only possible response to such an attitude is an equal blow. Over the course of a month, socialist cells accumulated strength, planned, and used all their connections. And now they were ready. On a warm spring morning, explosions were heard throughout the country, taking the lives of the highest command of the Portuguese Army. Simultaneously, rebel cells seized the most important government buildings. The red revolution had taken place."
 prt_event.5.a:0 "Finally, we are free!"

 prt_event.6.t:0 "Portugal in Flames"
 prt_event.6.d:0 "Today, Portugal began to lose its colonies, which declared that they do not want to have anything to do with the current government of the state. In the metropole itself, widespread unrest among traditionalists broke out. In such conditions, it is obvious that Portugal will not be able to maintain the previously concluded diplomatic agreements until its internal situation is normalized."
 prt_event.6.a:0 "Nightmarish situation!"
 
 prt_event.7.t:0 "The Counter-Revolution Awakens"
 prt_event.7.d:0 "Having accomplished our revolution, we fully understood that there were dissatisfied subjects left in society. And now they have come out of the shadows, starting active work to destroy the new order. We must do everything possible to save the country."
 prt_event.7.a:0 "Crush the Traitors!"

 prt_event.8.t:0 "Anarchy in Portugal"
 prt_event.8.d:0 "The growing instability and ongoing internal conflicts in the metropole have given us a unique opportunity. In the conditions of anarchy and actual civil war, the Portuguese government will be unable to hold us from gaining freedom. However, we should find a patron in case they decide to reclaim their territories."
 prt_event.8.a:0 "Let's celebrate our freedom!"

 prt_event.9.t:0 "Anarchy in Portugal"
 prt_event.9.d:0 "The growing instability and ongoing internal conflicts in Portugal have completely paralyzed their internal and foreign policy. Due to the fear of a possible civil war, some Portuguese fled to our country, which led to a rise in the popularity of socialist ideas throughout the country. However, we also have good news: some former Portuguese colonies have declared their independence and asked for our support, which will help us expand our sphere of influence."
 prt_event.9.a:0 "At least some benefit!"
 
 prt_event.10.t:0 "The First Step Towards Economic Greatness"
 prt_event.10.d:0 "Thanks to our sensible actions, the economic situation in the country has improved. Yes, it's too early to talk about greatness or even simple stability, but we are clearly moving in the right direction."
 prt_event.10.a:0 "Keep it up!"

 prt_event.11.t:0 "The Second Step Towards Economic Greatness"
 prt_event.11.d:0 "Through hard work and perseverance, we managed to restore Portugal's economy. However, we must not forget that while we were restoring it, other countries were advancing. We must exert additional efforts to catch up with other powers."
 prt_event.11.a:0 "At least now everything is stable..."

 prt_event.12.t:0 "Lisbon Metro"
 prt_event.12.d:0 "We did it! With pride, we presented our own metro to delegates from all over the world. Despite the fact that many analysts protested against its construction, calling the metro unnecessary for a relatively small city, we successfully completed the project. Now Lisbon stands in a row with Berlin, Constantinople, and Paris."
 prt_event.12.a:0 "We are the best in Iberia!"
 
 prt_event.13.t:0 "The Third Step Towards Economic Greatness"
 prt_event.13.d:0 "Our efforts have fully paid off, as Portugal's industrial and economic base has reached the level of a great power, sometimes even surpassing it. All doubts about the correctness of the path we chose have vanished. From now on, we are one of the most significant players on the economic Olympus of Europe."
 prt_event.13.a:0 "The nation rejoices!"

 prt_event.14.t:0 "Portugal Leaves Our Pact"
 prt_event.14.d:0 "Today, the diplomats of Portugal delivered a message from their government, stating that they are breaking any agreements with us and will now act solely in their own interests. This is extremely sad news, as we considered them our faithful allies."
 prt_event.14.a:0 "They will regret this"

 prt_event.15.t:0 "Portugal's Request"
 prt_event.15.d:0 "Today, representatives of Portugal's new ambitious government sent us a request to join our alliance. They explained their interest in the alliance with the desire to take revenge on the English for many years of dominance and exploitation of their empire. Their goals are similar to ours, as we have long desired to avenge the Austrians for similar transgressions. But should we unite with someone who is clearly weaker than us?"
 prt_event.15.a:0 "Allies are always needed"
 prt_event.15.b:0 "We can manage without them"
 
 prt_event.16.t:0 "Portugal Demands Concessions"
 prt_event.16.d:0 "Today, Portuguese diplomats came to us with a demand to return the lawful lands of Portugal. In particular, they demand the Azores and Galicia from us. The government is extremely skeptical of this ultimatum, but perhaps they are willing to do something to achieve their goal?"
 prt_event.16.a:0 "It's not worth risking"
 prt_event.16.b:0 "They are bluffing"

 prt_event.17.t:0 "Portugal Demands Submission"
 prt_event.17.d:0 "Today, Portuguese diplomats came to us with a demand for submission to their crown. Such a statement is simply ridiculous, as we are a kingdom with a long history, and submitting to them would mean forever discrediting ourselves. However, some people in the government are afraid of a possible attack if they refuse."
 prt_event.17.a:0 "We agree, provided they have autonomy"
 prt_event.17.b:0 "Never!"

 prt_event.18.t:0 "Alliance from Portugal"
 prt_event.18.d:0 "Today, Portuguese diplomats came to us with a proposal to create a socialist bloc that would claim to spread socialism across Europe and Iberia. In our society, two factions have emerged: those who advocate for unification and those who see it as a danger to sovereignty. What answer should we give them?"
 prt_event.18.a:0 "Of course, we agree!"
 prt_event.18.b:0 "We should not trust them"
 
 prt_event.19.t:0 "Unity of Iberia"
 prt_event.19.d:0 "Over the past time, we have become so close to Portugal that we have effectively integrated with each. In the context of this process, our friends have come up with the idea of a full unification of states. Many in our government agree with this step, but in this case, we may lose all our influence in the new state."
 prt_event.19.a:0 "We will be together"
 prt_event.19.b:0 "They have gone too far"

 prt_event.20.t:0 "Old Friends in One Body?"
 prt_event.20.d:0 "Diplomats from our former allied empire have come to us to revive our relations. They propose to start cooperation with mutual guarantees of independence. However, they are relatively far from us, so it is unclear how effective this pact will be."
 prt_event.20.a:0 "Let's revive the relations!"
 prt_event.20.b:0 "We don't need them."

 prt_event.21.t:0 "This is Our Future!"
 prt_event.21.d:0 "The growing instability and ongoing internal conflicts in the metropole have given us a unique opportunity. In the conditions of anarchy and actual civil war, the Portuguese government will be unable to hold us from gaining freedom. All that remains is not to fall under the influence of other great powers. Now we can conduct our affairs without looking back at anyone."
 prt_event.21.a:0 "For our freedom!"

 prt_event.22.t:0 "Portugal Intervened for Us"
 prt_event.22.d:0 "The official representatives of Portugal have announced full support for our cause and expressed their readiness to help us with all their might. Their assistance will be very useful."
 prt_event.22.a:0 "This is encouraging"

 PRT_Stay_put:0 "Stay Put"

 PRT_Strengthen_the_army:0 "Strengthen the Army"
 PRT_Strengthen_the_army_desc:0 "Recently, we have heard more rumors about armed socialist cells. It is necessary to empower the army with special powers so that it can have all the possibilities to suppress the rebels, otherwise Portugal may disappear from the map in a few months."
 PRT_Military_coup:0 "Military Coup"
 PRT_Military_coup_desc:0 "According to reports, the threat from socialists is too strong, but the current government does not pay enough attention to it. In such conditions, there can be no talk of the stability of the state. It becomes clear that only the military can rescue the state from the dirty hands of socialists and liberals willing to sell the country to French or English patrons."
 PRT_The_Queen_on_strings:0 "The Queen on Strings"
 PRT_The_Queen_on_strings_desc:0 "The royal family is a historical symbol of Portugal and has significant power, but in the current circumstances, they can destabilize the state. Therefore, the current head of the dynasty must submit to us. Otherwise, she will become as much of a threat as the crowds of traitors on the streets."
 PRT_The_power_of_reaction:0 "The Power of Reaction"
 PRT_The_power_of_reaction_desc:0 "Many radicals try to gain support by smearing conservatives and exposing our few shortcomings. These traitors have forgotten that before their arrival, Portugal was the bastion of stability and prosperity. Conservative reaction is the only correct system if we want to build a great future."
 PRT_The_Power_of_tradition:0 "The Power of Tradition"
 PRT_The_Power_of_tradition_desc:0 "Traditions are what our ancestors followed to create a prosperous state. Over time, they became corrupted by 'progressive' ideas. To preserve our pride and restore our former glory, we will return to the forgotten ideas and once again elevate them to the pedestal."
 PRT_Ray_of_the_Past:0 "Red Ray of the Past"
 PRT_Ray_of_the_Past_desc:0 "The eyes of our ancestors look at us with red rays from the past. They remind us of our former glory and stretch out their hand of support. So why should we reject it for foreign reforms and changes that will only lead to chaos and disorder?"
 PRT_Monopolize_power:0 "Monopolize Power"
 PRT_Monopolize_power_desc:0 "Power should not be accessible to everyone. Only a small group, well-versed in their goals, can effectively manage the state. We need to consolidate all power so that no opposition can influence our opinion."
 PRT_Night_of_the_Long_Knives:0 "Night of the Long Knives"
 PRT_Night_of_the_Long_Knives_desc:0 "As it turns out, there are many idiots in our country who are dissatisfied with our absolutely correct actions. In such a situation, we must eliminate the opposition. To do this, we just need to decapitate the most active of its actors, and the remaining rats will scatter in all directions."
 PRT_State_racial_theory:0 "State Racial Theory"
 PRT_State_racial_theory_desc:0 "Over the past centuries, Portugal has been on the path of colonization, which has led to the appearance of many alien peoples on its territory. Now we need to preserve the purity of the nation by preparing and implementing racial laws throughout the state."
 PRT_Power_for_Whites:0 "Power for Whites"
 PRT_Power_for_Whites_desc:0 "It is we who came to the territories of other peoples, which unequivocally indicates our supremacy. Only the white race has the right to enjoy the benefits of civilization. We must throw all the colored people into the ocean, freeing the state from foreign influence."
 PRT_A_power_that_no_king_has_ever_dreamed_of:0 "A Power That No King Has Ever Dreamed Of"
 PRT_A_power_that_no_king_has_ever_dreamed_of_desc:0 "Our actions have eliminated any opposition. Our government enjoys unprecedented popularity and support among the indigenous Portuguese. They are ready to give us absolute power to finally pull the state out of the liberal swamp."
 PRT_Underground_factories:0 "Underground Factories"
 PRT_Underground_factories_desc:0 "The strengthening of Portugal does not please many, and at the same time, a conflict is brewing in Europe that threatens to be more destructive than the Coalition Wars. Sooner or later, we will be drawn into the war, so it would be very wise to hide our factories so deep that no enemy can find them even under a microscope."
 PRT_A_new_path_for_Portugal:0 "A New Path for Portugal"
 PRT_A_new_path_for_Portugal_desc:0 "Our memories of past successes are great, but the time has come when they begin to become anchors for the chosen people. To get rid of this, from now on we will strive only forward, paving our own New Path for Portugal."

 PRT_Fanatical_militarism_desc:0 "An unprecedented surge in patriotism has affected all areas of the state. It has also reached the military sphere.

 PRT_Stay_on_your_own:0 "Stay on Your Own"
 PRT_Stay_on_your_own_desc:0 "Our great kingdom will never make the concessions that demanding liberals and, especially, socialist traitors require. It's time to show them the unyielding nature of our decisions, before it's too late."
 PRT_The_Great_Agreement:0 "The Great Agreement"
 PRT_The_Great_Agreement_desc:0 "New political currents are gaining strength in our state. It makes no sense to fight with each of them, so the most sensible solution would be to unite with some of them. We cannot fully agree with the goals of the liberals, but it will be much easier to reach an agreement with them than with the socialists."
 PRT_The_Queen_is_on_the_throne:0 "The Queen is on the Throne"
 PRT_The_Queen_is_on_the_throne_desc:0 "Even our liberal allies, despite their questionable views, recognized that a firm royal power would benefit Portugal. Strengthening the Queen's role as the head of state will help avoid serious consequences of the current political crisis."
 PRT_The_power_of_the_center:0 "The Power of the Center"
 PRT_The_power_of_the_center_desc:0 "To ensure stable governance, we must become the political center of the state and control all internal processes. Such control is likely to displease neither our supporters nor our opponents, but they will eventually accept it."

 PRT_New_features_in_the_old_body:0 "New Opportunities in the Old Body"
 PRT_New_features_in_the_old_body_desc:0 "Our desire to preserve the monarchy by no means means agreement with the conservative elite. Our population is currently significantly restricted by laws and prejudices. We must give the people new opportunities to improve their situation."
 PRT_Portugal_for_everyone:0 "Portugal for Everyone"
 PRT_Portugal_for_everyone_desc:0 "For a long time, a significant part of the Portuguese population was disenfranchised, which does not suit either us or the liberal public. Portugal must be adapted for the life of every subject of its royal majesty. Together, we will prepare reforms that will help achieve this goal."
 PRT_Invest_in_the_population:0 "Invest in the Population"
 PRT_Invest_in_the_population_desc:0 "Our state is quite wealthy on its own, but we know how to improve our position even further. The wealth of the population is the key to the success and prosperity of the Portuguese Kingdom. It will increase if we subsidize various areas of the economy and ease the tax burden on citizens."
 PRT_Tighten_your_belts:0 "Tighten Your Belts"
 PRT_Tighten_your_belts_desc:0 "Social support could significantly increase our popularity, but in the face of a conflict brewing in Europe, we will have to give it up. We need to convey to the citizens that if we want to reach the heights, we will all have to tighten our belts for some time."
 PRT_Controlled_democracy:0 "Controlled Democracy"

 PRT_Expand_liberal_reforms:0 "Expand Liberal Reforms"
 PRT_Expand_liberal_reforms_desc:0 "Our economy is experiencing a period of recovery. At this moment, liberal economists have developed market reforms that we need for further smooth development. Their adoption will strengthen the position of democrats in the government, but the benefit will far outweigh this shortcoming."
 PRT_The_War_on_Socialism:0 "The War on Socialism"
 PRT_The_War_on_Socialism_desc:0 "Socialists are traitors to Portugal. Their revolution will deal a fatal blow to the state, and their coming to power will mean the end of the history of a great state. It's time to declare war on them, before they declare war on us. Such a measure will cause the least damage to our country."
 PRT_New_Constitution:0 "New Constitution"
 PRT_New_Constitution_desc:0 "We have experienced the greatest political crisis in the history of Portugal. To prevent a new fall into the abyss of internecine strife, we will update our constitution. It will save the state from new shocks, making it strong and stable."
 PRT_To_suppress_discontent_in_the_colonies:0 "Suppress Discontent in the Colonies"
 PRT_To_suppress_discontent_in_the_colonies_desc:0 "Against the backdrop of political instability in the metropole, some colonies have begun to express dissatisfaction with our rule, which only worsens the situation. These outbursts must be brutally suppressed; they have not yet escalated into something more."
 PRT_Give_up_positions:0 "Give Up Positions"
 PRT_Give_up_positions_desc:0 "Portugal desperately needs reforms. Old systems of governance have proven their ineffectiveness and contributed to the current crisis. As long as we do not make concessions to the people, the state will not be able to break out of this vicious circle and will continue to sink deeper into chaos."
 PRT_Portuguese_Democracy:0 "Portuguese Democracy"
 PRT_Portuguese_Democracy_desc:0 "The victory of Portuguese democracy will give the country a boost into a bright future, protected from totalitarian despotic rule. Choosing this vector will cause extreme dissatisfaction among conservative elites, so it is worth reminding them of the existence of a greater evil in the form of socialists."
 PRT_Suppress_radicalism:0 "Suppress Radicalism"
 PRT_Suppress_radicalism_desc:0 "Radicals among us pose a great threat to new democratic values. Many supporters of socialism, not understanding it, destabilize society and undermine the foundations of the state. It's time to put out this fire before it burns out of control."

 PRT_Opportunities_for_everyone_desc:0 "In Portugal, every person should have equal rights, of course, if we want to build a free country. To achieve this, we will start a program to grant citizenship to all residents of our colonies, who have been oppressed before, and develop a new version of the constitution."
 PRT_The_Power_of_free_people:0 "The Power of Free People"
 PRT_The_Power_of_free_people_desc:0 "Free people are the key to the development of our entire society. By equalizing all the inhabitants of the state, we can legitimately free them.

 PRT_Defeat_the_influence_of_religion:0 "Defeat the Influence of Religion"
 PRT_Defeat_the_influence_of_religion_desc:0 "Religion is poison for the state and opium for the people. Church influence hinders us from conducting progressive policy and aligns its followers against us. It is necessary to separate religion from politics and state management."

 PRT_Independentortugal_desc:0 "For many years, we have been in the shadow of Britain, but now it is vulnerable and cannot forcefully keep us under its sphere of influence.

 PRT_Anti_British_relations_desc:0 "Our main territories are relatively small, so we have learned to compensate for this deficiency with colonial companies.

 PRT_German_defender_desc:0 "We are not the only nation that has suffered from an unscrupulous ally.

We must condemn and, if possible, resist them."
 PRT_Mass_appeal:0 "Mass Appeal"
 PRT_Mass_appeal_desc:0 "To be taken seriously as a major power, we must quickly increase our military might. For this, we will have to take unpopular measures such as a mass appeal of citizens to the army. This may also hit our economy, but we must make the necessary sacrifices."

 PRT_The_Iberian_Revolution_desc:0 "We have brought our society to socialism, but it would be wrong to stop there.

We must free our neighbors and bring them the benefits of socialism."
 PRT_Revolutionary_fortitude:0 "Revolutionary Fortitude"
 PRT_Revolutionary_fortitude_desc:0 "We must be prepared for the fact that we will not be greeted with open arms.

 PRT_Unity_with_Madrid_desc:0 "Although the central government was reactionary, there were sympathies for the revolution in many layers of the population. Relying on these masses, we can legitimize our governance of this land. Socialism goes beyond the borders of Portugal."

 PRT_The_war_with_Granada:0 "The War with Granada"
 PRT_The_war_with_Granada_desc:0 "Granada is a country with a long and heavy history, clinging to traditions with all its might.

 PRT_Complete_abolition_of_slavery:0 "Complete Abolition of Slavery"
 PRT_Complete_abolition_of_slavery_desc:0 "The abolition of lifelong slavery has significantly increased the professionalism and loyalty of our workers to the authority.

 PRT_Start_cutting_corners_desc:0 "Our economy has so many problems that trying to solve them all at once will only make things worse. In this situation, it would be more sensible to start with gradually solving the most critical issues, thereby encouraging citizens to approve of the new reforms."

 PRT_Portuguese_Colonial_Legion:0 "Portuguese Colonial Legion"
 PRT_Portuguese_Colonial_Legion_desc:0 "To everyone's surprise, our most combat-effective army units are currently the colonial troops supported by loyalists. Increasing the number of local residents in garrison can free up some experienced military personnel who are needed for army reform."
