 postrus.1.t:0 "Ultimatum"
 postrus.1.d:0 "The Turkic state demands that we become part of it, for the so-called Pan-Turkism. On one hand, agreeing would make us a stronger state, but we would lose independence. But is that really too high a price?"
 postrus.1.a:0 "Unity is better than death"
 postrus.1.b:0 "They shall not take our freedom!"

 #Time of Trouble Event

 #Herzen text event: "      After signing the act of capitulation and defining the borders of postwar Russia in Minsk, Mr. Alexander Ivanovich Herzen hurriedly left the capital, leaving only a document of his voluntary abdication as head of state.\n\n       Such a step can be seen as cowardice and fear to take responsibility before his own people, thus he will go down in history as the most inept politician of the 19th century!"

 #Ignatiev text event: "        It seems Mr. Ignatiev did not want to admit defeat in this conflict, as otherwise his absence at the signing of the capitulation act in Minsk cannot be explained.\n\n     Moreover, even in the capital no one resembling the head of state was seen - apparently he wished to avoid the people's wrath and responsibility for the tragedy at all costs, and to cover his tracks so that no one would know how pitiful a man looks who has lost all power and trust even of his seemingly loyal entourage..."

 chain.11.t:0 "Second Time of Troubles"
 chain.11.d:0 "     After the Great War, dark times came to Russia: old problems of defining the country's state system resurfaced, and problems thought long gone returned - many prominent politicians have different views on the issue of serfdom, some speak of the imperfection of the former government's reforms, and some want to restore it.\n\n      Nikolay Nekrasov called this event the 'Second Time of Troubles'. One thing is certain - even harsher trials await us than before."
 chain.11.a:0 "It can't get any worse..."

 chain.12.t:0 "Far East Leaves the Homeland"
 chain.12.d:0 "Your Excellency!\nI regret to inform you that your government is no longer able to protect the Russian people in the Far East, and therefore I have decided to introduce emergency powers in the region. Until the central government stabilizes the situation, the Far East will have to defend itself without relying on your forces. All the best!\nP.V. Kazakevich"
 chain.12.a:0 "Traitors must pay for their actions"
 chain.12.b:0 "Now is not the time for war"
 chain.12.c:0 "We have the right to freedom!"

 chain.13.t:0 "Alaska Declares Independence"
 chain.13.d:0 "     After losing the Far East, we also lost connection with Alaska - the situation is worsening.\n\n       Rumors say that Mr. Herzen fled there, intending to build a socialist state in Cromwelland.\n\n     Given that our fears have been repeatedly confirmed, we should expect the country to possibly collapse into many factions..."
 chain.13.a:0 "We can't do anything"
 chain.13.b:0 "For freedom, equality, brotherhood!"

 chain.14.t:0 "Turkic Uprising"
 chain.14.d:0 "     Some time later, as expected, the country's collapse continues: in southern Central Asia, the local population rose against our government.\n\n        They quickly consolidated in those lands, and we simply could do nothing about it.\n\n       The Turks proved stronger than us, and this disgrace will likely be remembered for centuries..."
 chain.14.a:0 "Damn them"
 chain.14.b:0 "Freedom from occupation!"

 chain.15.t:0 "Kazakh Front Defended Our Influence in Northern Central Asia"
 chain.15.d:0 "     It seemed the further collapse of our country was unstoppable, but thanks largely to the Kazakh front we managed to keep control over the north!\n\n     A small victorious war after a series of defeats, though minor, restored some trust in our government.\n\n       We only need to prepare people in local administration to maintain peace and order in the region..."
 chain.15.a:0 "At least some good news"
 chain.15.b:0 "We will protect the Russian minority"

 chain.16.t:0 "Kazakh Forces Routed Our Garrisons"
 chain.16.d:0 "     Today is another Day of Shame, as our garrison was driven out by small Kazakh forces from Kazakhstan itself.\n\n     As if God decided to send heavenly punishment for trying to hold power in foreign lands, plunging the country into fear and despair, as if He decided to test the Russian people with the hardest trials.\n\n      Apparently, we should not test His patience..."
 chain.16.a:0 "Damn savages"
 chain.16.b:0 "Let's drive enemies from our land"

 chain.17.t:0 "Kazakh Forces Captured Part of Our Southern Lands"
 chain.17.d:0 "     Seeing the weakness of our local authority, the Kazakhs decided to take advantage of the situation, attacking our southern lands and capturing some border territories.\n\n      This must not happen again, otherwise all countries of the world will want to turn us into their puppet without the ability to make independent decisions - including in foreign policy.\n\n        This cannot be allowed! Russia is a sovereign state!"
 chain.17.a:0 "Curse upon their heads"
 chain.17.b:0 "Russians out of our lands"

 chain.18.t:0 "Ignatiev's Betrayal"
 chain.18.d:0 "     Recently, in Omsk, on Ignatiev's initiative, a meeting of officers was held, where, as it turned out after the fact, the 'Salvation of Russia' government was formed, declaring itself legitimate and which, according to Ignatiev, will protect the country's interests.\n\n     This situation is extremely insulting to us, but we hardly have the strength now to do anything to prevent these fanatics from coming to power in the region..."
 chain.18.a:0 "Death to traitors"
 chain.18.b:0 "We don't have time for this"
 chain.18.c:0 "Moscow is lost, but the 'Great Judgment' is coming!"

 chain.19.t:0 "Peace During War"
 chain.19.d:0 "     Due to the accumulation of numerous internal problems, we must conclude a peace treaty on any terms, as ending the Great War will be the most reasonable and beneficial step for the Russian people - at least people will stop dying, and civil unrest is unlikely to become more radical than it is now.\n\n      We must finally solve the problems of separatism and the state's monopoly on violence, as trust in our government is rapidly falling."
 chain.19.a:0 "We have no other choice"

 chain.20.t:0 "The End of Russia"
 chain.20.d:0 "     It's hard to believe, but it happened: due to mutual accusations of all troubles on each other in the government, the unified Russian State no longer exists!\n\n        The government in Moscow declared itself the successor to the Decembrist regime of 1825, and beyond the Urals, chaos reigns! Now the same people who led the state to collapse are responsible for stability in the region.\n\n      Nevertheless, outside observers began calling this region Muscovy due to its territorial similarities with the Grand Duchy of Moscow."
 chain.20.a:0 "Moscow is not lost yet!"
 chain.20.b:0 "I don't want to see this horror"
 
 chain.21.t:0 "Noble Coup"
 chain.21.d:0 "     After the fall of the Government of Muscovy, monarchists consisting of noble officers and veterans of the Great War staged a coup, surrounding the Kremlin building and seizing communication lines, thereby forcing the newly forming government in Moscow to resign.\n\n        They blame many of the country's troubles on the Decembrist government, which failed to fulfill its promises and, most importantly, dragged the country into the bloody Great War, causing the whole world to mock us. Therefore, the revival of a stable and peaceful monarchy will be our only priority."
 chain.21.a:0 "Only the Tsar will save the country!"

 chain.22.t:0 "Coronation of Alexander II"
 chain.22.d:0 "     The monarchist union of Russia decided to declare the former Grand Duke Alexander Nikolaevich the rightful claimant to the Russian throne. They believe that the people should unite around one figure — the Tsar. The Decembrists, as they see it, ruined all the scientific and 'social' progress that the monarchy brought to Russia.\n\n        In his coronation speech, Alexander said: 'The Decembrists brought the country to the brink of losing sovereignty! Horrors began in 1825, and in the 1830s there was no stability at all. Ultimately, the Decembrists dragged Russia into a useless war. The Decembrists are entirely responsible for what they did to our Motherland! I will not allow this; I will not allow the country to be drawn into another conflict — unless it threatens Russia's sovereignty, I will not allow destabilization!'\n\n       These comments were met with admiration by many, but representatives of the former forming government simply walked out of the event with great determination, as if they had not yet given up their struggle..."
 chain.22.a:0 "God Save the Tsar!"

 chain.23.t:0 "Northern Uprising"
 chain.23.d:0 "     In the north, specifically in the lands of Novgorod, an anti-monarchist uprising began under the leadership of Chapsky, who claims that centuries of monarchy will lead the country to further stagnation and backwardness compared to other European countries, which cannot be allowed:\n      'Centuries of monarchy have shown and proven its inefficiency as a state system — tyranny always leads to extremely deplorable consequences for both the ruler and the country he governs.'"
 chain.23.a:0 "Destroy these rebels!"

 chain.24.t:0 "Petrograd Lost!"
 chain.24.d:0 "     After the start of the Northern Uprising, the Scandinavian government, taking advantage of our weakness, brazenly decided to establish control over Saint Petersburg under the pretext of creating an international mandate status for the city.\n\n      It seems that we have now lost control over the Baltic Sea as well. The basileus's puppets decided to destroy our sovereignty at all costs, but the collective West led by the Greeks will pay for this!"
 chain.24.a:0 "We can do nothing now"

 chain.25.t:0 "International Mandate of Saint Petersburg"
 chain.25.d:0 "     Diplomats from the British Isles, Romey, Germany, and Scandinavia decided to sign an agreement granting Petrograd the status of an international mandate and formalizing its German name at the international level.\n\n        Representatives of the Russian side were also present, but they had no choice but to formally acknowledge the fait accompli, as almost all parties involved agreed."
 chain.25.a:0 "We will take the city back"

 chain.26.t:0 "Novgorod Raises Its Head"
 chain.26.d:0 "     After rumors spread about the murder of one of Chapsky's supporters right outside the Kremlin walls in Novgorod, unprecedented unrest erupted in the region, escalating into an armed rebellion against monarchist forces.\n\n      The situation is truly dire, as brother now fights brother, and son fights father — the Russian people have never seen such a brutal war..."
 chain.26.a:0 "For the Tsar!"
 chain.26.b:0 "For the Republic!"

 chain.27.t:0 "Time of Troubles"
 chain.27.d:0 "     At the moment, the Russian people are facing enormous difficulties: the Far East is under the control of a junta, Alaska is now the poorest region of former Russian territory, revanchists have entrenched themselves in Omsk, socialists are building their experiment in Alaska, and in Muscovy there is active confrontation between supporters of democratic forces and monarchists.\n\n     Troubles pursue Russia and its people one after another, but we will overcome the Time of Troubles as we have before, because after midnight always comes dawn!"
 chain.27.a:0 "We will break through this darkness!"
