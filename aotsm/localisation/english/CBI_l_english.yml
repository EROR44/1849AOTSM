 ### Focus ###
 
 CBI_continue_line:0 "Continue Lamb's Policy"
 CBI_continue_line_desc:0 "And another year has passed... Lamb has held the position of Lord Protector for 25 years, during which many events have occurred in the life of the Confederation, but unfortunately not very positive ones, ultimately leading to the loss of almost everything achieved in the 18th century."
 CBI_visit_to_france:0 "Lamb Travels to France"

 CBI_visit_to_russian:0 "Lamb and the Decembrists"
 CBI_visit_to_russian_desc:0 "After the Decembrists' success in Russia, our relations have reached a new level. Though they are not yet our ally, it is only a matter of time, and this meeting is one of the most important steps in that direction."
 CBI_economi_reform:0 "The Last Chance for the Economy"

 CBI_help_people:0 "Helping the Citizens"
 CBI_help_people_desc:0 "If we do not start a war for the minds of the citizens now, the Chartists will become bolder and challenge us directly. We cannot allow their popularity to grow, as they could destroy all of Cromwell's legacy!"
 CBI_will_of_lem:0 "Lamb Writes a Will"
 CBI_will_of_lem_desc:0 "Lamb has been in power for a long time, so the parliament has asked him to write a will and choose the next Lord Protector. If he fails to do so, truly difficult times will begin in Britain."
 CBI_next_lord_protector:0 "Next Lord Protector"
 CBI_next_lord_protector_desc:0 "In the Confederation, the issue of the Lord Protector's succession has always been particularly interesting, as this event happens no more than once every two generations. Therefore, every Briton today awaits to find out who will be next."

 CBI_eduard_smit_stenli:0 "Edward Smith-Stanley"
 CBI_eduard_smit_stenli_desc:0 "If Lamb had managed to write a will, many would agree that Edward would have become his heir. In every speech, he emphasized Lamb's significance for the entire Confederation, but what future awaits us under his leadership?"
 CBI_help_colony:0 "Help to the Colonies"
 CBI_help_colony_desc:0 "We help them now, and later they will help us. With such a stance, we will always be in profit."

 CBI_new_trade_politic_desc:0 "Let's be honest — we need money, and what better way than selling resources to quickly restore a minimal budget?"
 CBI_first_comprimis:0 "First Compromise"
 CBI_first_comprimis_desc:0 "We must not forget the people, as the risk of a Chartist uprising has only increased after Lamb's death."
 CBI_lem_statue:0 "Erect Statues of Lamb"
 CBI_lem_statue_desc:0 "A statue of Lamb in every yard! Although... perhaps better in the capital of each Block. Wouldn't that be better?"

 CBI_freedom_for_love_desc:0 "It's time to show our Blocks that we can use the carrot instead of the stick."
 CBI_visit_block:0 "Unplanned Visit"

 CBI_lem_reform_profit:0 "Benefit of Lamb's Reforms"
 CBI_lem_reform_profit_desc:0 "It was a shock to everyone that the completed project of Lamb's reforms not only began to restore the economy but is doing so so rapidly that we have a chance to become, if not the first, then definitely the second economy in the world!"
 CBI_genri_templ:0 "Henry Temple"
 CBI_genri_templ_desc:0 "It is hard to find a person who tries harder than Henry Temple to satisfy everyone. In his speeches, he simultaneously judged Lamb for his mistakes and praised him for his reforms. The Confederation is clearly not very happy with such a Lord Protector."
 CBI_new_administration:0 "Update Officials List"
 CBI_new_administration_desc:0 "The first changes of ruling officials across the country have begun. Rumor has it that the Cromwellians-A want to remain the only party with real power."
 CBI_not_peacfull_time:0 "Unpeaceful Times"
 CBI_not_peacfull_time_desc:0 "Henry Temple ends every speech and address by saying that these are troubled times and Britain must be ready for anything. It is interesting what this ending of his speeches is connected with?"
 CBI_russian_will_resist:0 "London-Petrograd Pact"
 CBI_russian_will_resist_desc:0 "Britain must not allow two things: first, monarchies, and second, the fall of Russia. The first is not threatening us now, so all efforts must be mobilized to prevent Russia's collapse."
 CBI_reform_taxating:0 "Taxation Reform"
 CBI_reform_taxating_desc:0 "We must always think about the people, and lowering taxes is the best incentive to keep the ruling circles calm."
 CBI_fund_for_politic:0 "Pounds for Power"

 CBI_jordj_rassel:0 "John Russell"
 CBI_jordj_rassel_desc:0 "Probably the person least wanted to be chosen, but arguing with Parliament was impossible, so everyone had to accept that such a militaristic man took such an important role in the government."
 CBI_new_boss:0 "New Boss of London"
 CBI_new_boss_desc:0 "John's first decree was to move the Lord Protector's residence to Kensington Palace. Rumor has it he is turning it into his fortress."

 CBI_not_republic_just_protectorat:0 "Dissolve Parliament"

 CBI_cut_the_hand:0 "Cut Off the Hand"
 CBI_cut_the_hand_desc:0 "John Russell promised to defeat corruption, and despite how deeply it was rooted in British society, he managed to do what others could not: start fighting not with words, but with actions. The 'Anti-Bribery' bill showed everyone that joking with Russell was a mistake. Now anyone guilty of corruption will be arrested for a month and have one hand cut off."
 CBI_military_observer:0 "Military Oversight"
 CBI_military_observer_desc:0 "Only the military can effectively control the Blocks, so they have been granted special rights allowing any kind of control on the Confederation's lands."
 CBI_militarasy_economy:0 "Militarization of the Economy"
 CBI_militarasy_economy_desc:0 "In these hard years, Britain's economy is only a shadow of its former might, but with Russell's reforms, the economy has not only begun rapid recovery but also shifted onto a military footing."

 CBI_financial_collapse_1:0 "Economic Collapse"
 CBI_financial_collapse_1_desc:0 "The liberal reforms continued by William Lamb, including in the economy, led to tragic consequences, weakening the Cromwell Pound and the Confederation's position on the international stage.\n\nCurrently, the country's currency and the entire economy face uncertain prospects, and it is unclear whether the state can recover from the ongoing crisis."

 CBI_financial_collapse_3:0 "Recession"

However, fortunately, the Confederation's economy managed to avoid the worst consequences and has now moved from depression into recession, which suggests that further economic growth is only a matter of time.\n\nIt can now be confidently said that the fog of uncertainty is behind us, and economists are building quite positive forecasts for the British economy."
 CBI_financial_collapse_4:0 "Stagnation"

 CBI_outdated_army:0 "Outdated Armed Forces"
 CBI_outdated_army_desc:0 "The British Confederation Army and Navy are severely outdated. The last military reform, dated 1818, failed to bring Britain's armed forces to the pan-European level even then, and today the army and navy are hopelessly obsolete."
