 ### Focus ###
 
 CBI_continue_line:0 "Continue Lamb's Policy"
 CBI_continue_line_desc:0 "And another year has passed... Lamb has held the position of Lord Protector for 25 years, during which many events have occurred in the life of the Confederation, but unfortunately not very positive ones, ultimately leading to the loss of almost everything achieved in the 18th century."

 CBI_visit_to_russian:0 "Lamb and the Decembrists"
 CBI_visit_to_russian_desc:0 "After the Decembrists' success in Russia, our relations have reached a new level. Though they are not yet our ally, it is only a matter of time, and this meeting is one of the most important steps in that direction."
 CBI_economi_reform:0 "The Last Chance for the Economy"

 CBI_help_people:0 "Helping the Citizens"
 CBI_help_people_desc:0 "If we do not start a war for the minds of the citizens now, the Chartists will become bolder and challenge us directly. We cannot allow their popularity to grow, as they could destroy all of Cromwell's legacy!"
 CBI_will_of_lem:0 "Lamb Writes a Will"
 CBI_will_of_lem_desc:0 "Lamb has been in power for a long time, so the parliament has asked him to write a will and choose the next Lord Protector. If he fails to do so, truly difficult times will begin in Britain."
 CBI_next_lord_protector:0 "Next Lord Protector"
 CBI_next_lord_protector_desc:0 "In the Confederation, the issue of the Lord Protector's succession has always been particularly interesting, as this event happens no more than once every two generations. Therefore, every Briton today awaits to find out who will be next."

 CBI_eduard_smit_stenli:0 "Edward Smith-Stanley"
 CBI_eduard_smit_stenli_desc:0 "If Lamb had managed to write a will, many would agree that Edward would have become his heir. In every speech, he emphasized Lamb's significance for the entire Confederation, but what future awaits us under his leadership?"
 CBI_help_colony:0 "Help to the Colonies"
 CBI_help_colony_desc:0 "We help them now, and later they will help us. With such a stance, we will always be in profit."

 CBI_lem_statue:0 "Erect Statues of Lamb"
 CBI_lem_statue_desc:0 "A statue of Lamb in every yard! Although... perhaps better in the capital of each Block. Wouldn't that be better?"

 CBI_visit_block:0 "Unplanned Visit"

 CBI_lem_reform_profit:0 "Benefit of Lamb's Reforms"
 CBI_lem_reform_profit_desc:0 "It was a shock to everyone that the completed project of Lamb's reforms not only began to restore the economy but is doing so so rapidly that we have a chance to become, if not the first, then definitely the second economy in the world!"
 CBI_genri_templ:0 "Henry Temple"
 CBI_genri_templ_desc:0 "It is hard to find a person who tries harder than Henry Temple to satisfy everyone. In his speeches, he simultaneously judged Lamb for his mistakes and praised him for his reforms. The Confederation is clearly not very happy with such a Lord Protector."
 CBI_new_administration:0 "Update Officials List"
 CBI_new_administration_desc:0 "The first changes of ruling officials across the country have begun. Rumor has it that the Cromwellians-A want to remain the only party with real power."
 CBI_not_peacfull_time:0 "Unpeaceful Times"
 CBI_not_peacfull_time_desc:0 "Henry Temple ends every speech and address by saying that these are troubled times and Britain must be ready for anything. It is interesting what this ending of his speeches is connected with?"
 CBI_russian_will_resist:0 "London-Petrograd Pact"
 CBI_russian_will_resist_desc:0 "Britain must not allow two things: first, monarchies, and second, the fall of Russia. The first is not threatening us now, so all efforts must be mobilized to prevent Russia's collapse."

 CBI_reform_taxating_desc:0 "We must always think about the people, and lowering taxes is the best incentive to keep the ruling circles calm."
 CBI_fund_for_politic:0 "Pounds for Power"

 CBI_jordj_rassel:0 "John Russell"

 CBI_new_boss:0 "New Boss of London"

 CBI_not_republic_just_protectorat:0 "Dissolve Parliament"

 CBI_cut_the_hand:0 "Cut Off the Hand"
 CBI_cut_the_hand_desc:0 "John Russell promised to defeat corruption, and despite how deeply it was rooted in British society, he managed to do what others could not: start fighting not with words, but with actions. The 'Anti-Bribery' bill showed everyone that joking with Russell was a mistake. Now anyone guilty of corruption will be arrested for a month and have one hand cut off."
 CBI_military_observer:0 "Military Oversight"
 CBI_military_observer_desc:0 "Only the military can effectively control the Blocks, so they have been granted special rights allowing any kind of control on the Confederation's lands."
 CBI_militarasy_economy:0 "Militarization of the Economy"
 CBI_militarasy_economy_desc:0 "In these hard years, Britain's economy is only a shadow of its former might, but with Russell's reforms, the economy has not only begun rapid recovery but also shifted onto a military footing."

However, fortunately, the Confederation's economy managed to avoid the worst consequences and has now moved from depression into recession, which suggests that further economic growth is only a matter of time.\n\nIt can now be confidently said that the fog of uncertainty is behind us, and economists are building quite positive forecasts for the British economy."
 CBI_financial_collapse_4:0 "Stagnation"

 CBI_outdated_army:0 "Outdated Armed Forces"
 CBI_outdated_army_desc:0 "The British Confederation Army and Navy are severely outdated. The last military reform, dated 1818, failed to bring Britain's armed forces to the pan-European level even then, and today the army and navy are hopelessly obsolete."

 ### EVENT ###
 
 cbi_frr.1.t:0 "Visit to France"
 cbi_frr.1.d:0 "        Lem announced that he plans to visit Paris to establish relations between our countries. The Parliament expressed approval of this idea and wished success for this diplomatic mission. Lem himself is confident that this trip will be successful."
 cbi_frr.1.a:0 "Paris, here we come"

 cbi_frr.2.t:0 "Technology Exchange"
 cbi_frr.2.d:0 "        During the visit of Lord Protector William Lem, further relations between Britain and France were discussed, and the issue of the first interstate agreement on a one-time exchange of scientific experience was raised. The French government is somewhat concerned about this proposal due to the lack of warm relations in the past. Charles Lagrange, in turn, expressed support for Lem's initiative."
 cbi_frr.2.a:0 "We should agree"
 cbi_frr.2.b:0 "This contradicts the foundations of socialism!"

 cbi_frr.3.t:0 "The French Agree"
 cbi_frr.3.d:0 "        As expected, France agreed to a one-time technology exchange. Lem has already returned to London, hinting at a possible follow-up trip within six months. As a result of these agreements, pressure on the Chartists was reduced due to Lem's words about France's friendly socialism."
 cbi_frr.3.a:0 "This is a step to a new level of relations"

 cbi_frr.4.t:0 "The French Refused"
 cbi_frr.4.d:0 "        Lem returned very gloomy. On the first day, Parliament did not ask about the meeting, but he could not delay the question for long. So after discussing the visit to France, Lem told how warmly he was received, that socialism there is not as it is seen in the Confederation, but at the end of his speech he added that unfortunately he could not reach an agreement with the French."
 cbi_frr.4.a:0 "It seems we are trying to befriend them too early"

 cbi_frr.5.t:0 "Paris Treaty"
 cbi_frr.5.d:0 "        British envoys arrived in Paris to resolve issues of future cooperation.\nThe British propose an exchange of resources and specialists, as well as the possibility of joining the London Pact in the future."
 cbi_frr.5.a:0 "Agree to their proposals"
 cbi_frr.5.b:0 "Refuse"

 cbi_frr.6.t:0 "New Member of the London Pact"
 cbi_frr.6.d:0 "        The moment has come when we were offered to join the London Pact, and we were even given a choice. Prussia is strengthening in Europe now, and joining this alliance might help us hold out."
 cbi_frr.6.a:0 "Let's make Europe stable!"
 cbi_frr.6.b:0 "We have no reason to join their alliance"

 cbi_pru.1.t:0 "Visit to Prussia"
 cbi_pru.1.d:0 "        Parliament fell into a state of extreme anxiety after Lem's unexpected announcement of his intention to visit Prussia. This step caused a wave of discussions among the lords, who feared possible consequences of such a diplomatic maneuver with a state whose relations cannot even remotely be called friendly.\n\n        William, however, insisted that his actions were aimed solely at strengthening the Confederation's position on the international stage. He argued that the visit to Prussia was necessary to establish closer ties and reduce tensions between the countries, which could ensure the state's stability and prosperity. These theses became the main purpose of the trip, and Parliament ultimately was forced to silently approve the Lord Protector's departure to Berlin."
 cbi_pru.1.a:0 "We're already rushing to Berlin"

 cbi_pru.2.t:0 "Leypoldite Agreement"
 cbi_pru.2.d:0 "        Today, a meeting was held in the Reichstag with a recently arrived diplomatic delegation headed by [CBI.GetLeader]. The Prussian Chancellor [PRU.GetLeader] met with representatives of the Confederation. The agenda included issues of further cooperation between the two powers, with the main topic being the possibility of technology exchange, including military technology. William offered Prussia assistance in developing advanced weapons in exchange for supplies of the rare mineral leypoldite, which holds strategic importance for British industry.\n\n        Von Radovitz expressed preliminary agreement with the proposal, emphasizing the importance of establishing friendly relations to maintain peace in Europe. However, he also noted that the final decision on this matter would depend on the king's opinion, as the Reichstag is currently not ready to support such an initiative. Nevertheless, both sides expressed hope for successful completion of negotiations and strengthening of mutually beneficial partnership."
 cbi_pru.2.a:0 "We can still supply some leypoldite"
 cbi_pru.2.b:0 "A deal with the British? Never!"

 cbi_pru.3.t:0 "Prussian Government Agrees!"
 cbi_pru.3.d:0 "        As soon as Lem returned to London, he immediately went to Westminster Palace to report the phenomenal success of his trip. The entire Parliament was shocked by his success, and the King of Prussia personally signed the agreement in Lem's presence. Now Lem's influence on the nation has significantly increased."
 cbi_pru.3.a:0 "How unexpected and pleasant"

 cbi_pru.4.t:0 "Prussia Did Not Respond"
 cbi_pru.4.d:0 "        Returning to London, Lem was reluctant to go to Westminster Palace, as criticism awaited him there. But the day after his return, he spoke there and reported the failure of his trip. Parliament immediately began attacking him with phrases like 'We told you,' 'We warned you.' As soon as the meeting ended and Lem stepped outside, it was noticeable that he had aged several years abruptly."
 cbi_pru.4.a:0 "It was worth hoping"

 cbi_pru.5.t:0 "Konigsberg Meeting"
 cbi_pru.5.d:0 "        Today, representatives of the British Parliament arrived in Konigsberg to discuss cooperation between our countries.\nPerhaps it is worth starting a dialogue with them to resolve issues between our nations, but is it really worth it?"
 cbi_pru.5.a:0 "The issue can be resolved"
 cbi_pru.5.b:0 "It's not worth it"

 cbi_pru.6.t:0 "Break of the British-German Leypoldite Agreement"
 cbi_pru.6.d:0 "        German specialists, who thanks to agreements reached by William Lem with the German government established leypoldite production on the territory of the Confederation, have left the country. Considering that the government entered the war against Germany, this was an obvious and inevitable event. However, this has now led to the synthesis of such a strategically important resource as leypoldite becoming impossible.\n\n        The House of Lords and the country's industrialists have expressed deep concern about the break of the agreement. They understand that the absence of leypoldite will negatively affect the technical equipment level of the armed forces and will not allow the Confederation to reduce its technological lag..."
 cbi_pru.6.a:0 "A sad but obvious outcome..."

 cbi_rus.1.t:0 "Visit to Russia"
 cbi_rus.1.d:0 "        At William Lem's speech in the House of Lords, there was even an ambassador from Russia who was pleased to hear about the Confederation of British Isles leader's intention to meet with the Russian government. Many years of friendship between the two countries, based on mutually beneficial trade via the Northern Sea Route through Arkhangelsk, create hope for strengthening ties. Parliament wanted to fund the Lord Protector's trip from the budget, but this expense was covered by the Russian side, which became a symbolic gesture of friendship and cooperation.\n\n        This outcome brings joy among the Confederation's residents, who see it as an opportunity to improve the economic situation and establish diplomatic relations. The visit to Russia opens new horizons for trade and joint projects, which can significantly strengthen the positions of both countries on the international stage. The meeting is expected to be an important step toward further development of relations between the Confederation and Russia, benefiting both peoples."
 cbi_rus.1.a:0 "Direct course to Petrograd"

 cbi_rus.2.t:0 "Joint Exercises"
 cbi_rus.2.d:0 "       Lord Protector William Lem was warmly welcomed in Petrograd, where he was received by [RUS.GetLeader] — President of the Russian State. A ceremonial meeting was held at the Winter Palace, where further steps to strengthen relations between the Confederation of British Isles and Russia were discussed. The negotiations were very successful, which became another testament to the long-standing friendship between the two powers, based on mutually beneficial cooperation and trade.\n\n        The main focus of the meeting was on conducting joint military exercises within the London Pact. Both leaders agreed that such exercises would not only strengthen military cooperation but also increase the combat readiness of the armed forces of both countries. This decision received positive feedback from both military personnel and civilians, who see this step as an opportunity to further strengthen security and stability in the region. At the end of the negotiations, it was decided..."
 cbi_rus.2.a:0 "...to conduct exercises near the borders of Prussia."
 cbi_rus.2.b:0 "...to refuse to conduct joint exercises."
 cbi_rus.3.t:0 "Russia Agrees, But With Conditions"
 cbi_rus.3.d:0 "        Lord Protector [CBI.GetLeader] returned to the London port, where he was met with great respect and interest. Upon disembarking, Lem immediately shared news about his trip to Petrograd, noting that the Russian side agreed to conduct joint military exercises. Although the purpose of his visit also included new trade agreements, the main result was the agreement on joint exercises aimed at strengthening military cooperation between the two powers.\n\n        However, the Russian government has certain conditions: the exercises must take place in the territories of the Warsaw, Kalisz, Łomża, Piotrków, Płock, Suwałki, Kovno, and Courland governorates. This decision emphasizes the importance of respecting the interests of both countries and the desire for mutually beneficial cooperation. Lem expressed confidence that the joint exercises will not only improve combat readiness but also become an important step in strengthening long-term relations between the Confederation of British Isles and Russia."
 cbi_rus.3.a:0 "Let's drink to our friends!"

 cbi_rus.4.t:0 "Russia Opposes"
 cbi_rus.4.d:0 "       Lord Protector [CBI.GetLeader] sadly disembarked at the London port, reporting the failure of his negotiations with the Russian government. Despite concluding minor trade agreements, the main goal of the trip — conducting joint military exercises — was not supported by the Russian side. Lem noted that the Russian leadership cited more important matters than soldier training, leaving him disappointed.\n\n        Lem also expressed concern about the clear cooling of relations between Petrograd and London. He believes this turn of events may negatively affect future cooperation between the two countries. Returning to the Isles almost empty-handed, the Lord Protector realized he faces a difficult task of restoring trust and strengthening ties with Russia amid growing uncertainty."
 cbi_rus.4.a:0 "Funding for the Moscow company should be cut..."

 cbi_rus.5.t:0 "Visit of the British Diplomatic Mission"
 cbi_rus.5.d:0 "        Today, British diplomats arrived in [195.GetName], which, however, was not a surprise for the city's social circles and government. The main goal of the visit was declared as expanding trade cooperation within the Northern Sea Route framework, as well as concluding agreements on the supply of British industrial goods on mutually beneficial terms.\n\n         The fact of such cooperation expansion was obviously predictable and beneficial for both Russians and British. However, there is a possibility of negative perception of such cooperation by a third party, which may lead to increased tensions between countries in Europe..."
 cbi_rus.5.a:0 "Strengthening relations with London is a good idea"
 cbi_rus.5.b:0 "It's not worth the risk"

 cbi_rus.6.t:0 "Moscow and London"
 cbi_rus.6.d:0 "        Despite many years of friendship between the countries, the visit of the British diplomatic mission was a complete surprise to us. Entering the country incognito, they revealed themselves to only a few, and the general population still does not know about their arrival in [195.GetName]. \n\n       The reason for such a secretive appearance was an invitation to join [CBI.GetFactionName], which in the current situation may promise us support in case of a pan-European war. However, will [CBI.GetName] become a worthy ally? Or will such an agreement only accelerate the escalation of events in Europe, destroying the balance of power on the continent..."
 cbi_rus.6.a:0 "Together we are stronger!"
 cbi_rus.6.b:0 "We have no reason to join their alliance"

 cbi_rus.7.t:0 "Cooperation with the British"

 cbi_byz.1.d:0 "The British want to trade again in the Mediterranean, which will give them economic bonuses, but they also promise to reconsider the borders of their colonies in the future and likely transfer new lands to us."
 cbi_byz.1.a:0 "Alright, we agree"
 cbi_byz.1.b:0 "Only if they crawl on their knees"

 cbi_byz.2.t:0 "Cape Deal"
 cbi_byz.2.d:0 "        Recently, a new proposal arrived from London. Of course, we are not very eager to listen, but after the start of their détente policy towards us, it is better to hear them out.\n\n            And we did not regret it, as they ask us to conclude a non-aggression pact, but they are ready in return to reconsider colonial borders. Most interestingly, they are ready to fully transfer colonies in Africa to us, thereby resolving the disputed region issue.\n\n         Of course, such an offer looks tempting, but advisors still recommend refusing it. London's and Petrograd's flirtations are clearly aimed at destabilizing our state. Therefore, if there is a non-aggression pact between Constantinople and London, we will not be able to mitigate the harm from their actions."
 cbi_byz.2.a:0 "A good compromise"
 cbi_byz.2.b:0 "Do they take us for idiots?"

 cbi_byz.3.t:0 "Romea Agrees"
 cbi_byz.3.d:0 "        Constantinople signed the non-aggression pact and now we can focus on more important matters. Of course, we must not forget the threat from the Rhomeans, but this pact will allow us to accumulate strength for the first strike.\n\n      Of course, the press expresses mixed opinions due to the fact that we have ceded such a vast territory to the enemy. In our defense to those opposing us, we repeat that all our actions are aimed at ensuring peace and prosperity for the Confederation...\n\n        How can they not understand that life is worth more than a miserable piece of land?"
 cbi_byz.3.a:0 "Excellent news"
 cbi_byz.4.t:0 "Romea Refuses to Sign the Treaty"
 cbi_byz.4.d:0 "        Those damn Greeks refused the treaty, and now it is clear that their ambitions will not end with just Africa. We must now devise a plan of action and be ready for these fools to start hostilities against us.\n\n        All advisors and diplomats were confident that the promise of such a huge piece of land would satisfy Romea's ambitions, but no, they crave much more. Probably their decision is due to the fact that their recent actions have had mostly positive effects.\n\n        Could it be that land is more important to them than life?"
 cbi_byz.4.a:0 "What a nuisance..."

 cbi.1.t:0 "Lem's Will"
 cbi.1.d:0 "Well done, I understand the desire to quickly see the focuses and what happens next, but I must disappoint you — Lem will die only in July of this year, and only then will you be able to continue playing."
 cbi.1.a:0 "Cheater"

 cbi.2.t:0 "Lem's Heir"
 cbi.2.d:0 "I thought the previous message made it clear that it's better not to cheat here? Well, if that didn't work, I must disappoint you again — this event excludes the election outcome, meaning there will be no new leader and no further focuses without cheats. Well done, what can I say."
 cbi.2.a:0 "Congrats on the restart"

The Cromwellians-A propose maintaining the status quo but solving the budget problem by increasing contributions from Confederation members. The Cromwellians-R propose abolishing the internal army of each block to create a central military command under the personal control of the Lord Protector.\nParliament decided that:"

The Cromwellians-L propose continuing the decentralization policy in this area to avoid financial problems. The Cromwellians-A propose starting gradual centralization of the fleet to be ready for a quick response during war. The Cromwellians-R propose sending a message to all Blocks after the meeting about transferring their fleets to form a single Confederation fleet.\nParliament decided that:"

The Cromwellians-L immediately responded that they intend to maintain Lem's policy of decentralization but added that the world situation may require temporary centralization measures. The Cromwellians-A proposed that the Confederation maintain decentralization to a lesser extent while continuing care for each Block. The Cromwellians-R representative gave a speech about the need for centralization of the state, creating a strong and united state capable of resisting anyone who would challenge British influence.\nParliament decided that the option:"

 cbi.21.d:0 "For Lem, this day seemed endless. After preparations began for the election of the next Lord Protector, many politicians sent him their documents to be chosen. But William was in no hurry to decide, so time dragged slowly. However, closer to six in the evening, one of the Cromwell party’s financiers, John Molteno, entered his office. Lem was about to ask what he was doing there and why he came in without knocking, but as soon as he opened his mouth, John began speaking himself:\n– “You know, William, I do so many good things for the party, but the party does nothing for me.” – he said calmly. – “Let’s do this: you give me rights to land ownership in South Africa, and I will arrange an important trading partner for Britain there.”\n– “First, you didn’t even say hello, and second, what partner? South Africa is land under our country’s control...” – Lem said with slight displeasure.\n– “You know, Lem, I have done so much to strengthen your power.” – John said slowly. – “Wouldn’t it be bad if my money went not to the party but to support the Chartists? Yes, that would be very bad, and the funniest thing is they invited me there.”\n– “Are you mad? How can I give you part of the state because of such provocation?” – Lem said with obvious displeasure. – “One word from me, and you will be executed as a traitor to Cromwell’s cause! Guards!”\nThe guards entered the room at that moment, but instead of trying to seize John, they slowly approached Lem.\n– “Well, my friend? Will you sign the document creating the Dominion of South Africa under my control?” – John said with a smirk, then threw the documents on Lem’s desk.\nToday, Lem realized that in his liberal Britain, freedom has long been ruled not by liberty, but by those who own the majority of capital. Is this the Britain he wanted to build..."

 cbi.22.d:0 "      By 1849, in the Confederation, amid growing tensions with Romea and Prussia, engineering innovations became the key to preserving the republic’s power. At this time, on Rambold Street in Lincoln, known for its workshops and factories, two talented engineers — Watkinson and Robey — laid the foundation for the future company Robey & Co. They plan to focus on the development and production of portable engines and equipment that could be used both for peaceful purposes and in wartime conditions.\n\n      Initially, the company produces small batches of products, but the quality of their work has already attracted the attention of military and industrial customers. It seems that soon the reputation of Watkinson and Robey’s craftsmanship will spread throughout the country.\n\n      It can be expected that in the near future Robey & Co will become a symbol of technological progress and innovation, a harbinger of great future achievements in mechanical engineering and industrial production."

After the apartment search and arrival of the medical examiner, it was concluded that Lem died of natural causes.

If we can't end Sweeney's story, he might run away or worse. But the question remains... Where should we look for him? Of course, raiding the pie shop sounds most logical. But according to our data, lately, neither Lovett nor Todd have been there very often. On the other hand, they clearly roam the streets. Because of this, capturing them right on the street might be a more effective method, assuming they don't know they're being hunted.

This operation requires not only a successful amphibious assault but also subsequent consolidation of forces for further advancement. The command unanimously agrees that the landing must be carefully planned to establish a stable bridgehead to support operations against German troops on the Eastern Front.\n\n     One of the considered landing sites is the area near Bremen. This strategically important port city can provide rapid deployment of additional forces and resources. A successful operation in this region would put significant pressure on German positions, diverting their attention from the Eastern Front. However, it must be taken into account that the area near Bremen is guarded by well-prepared German troops, which may complicate the mission.\n\n    On the other hand, a landing in Normandy appears more risky, given its occupation by German forces. Nevertheless, this route offers the element of surprise and the possibility of quickly capturing territory with minimal losses. A successful operation in Normandy could significantly weaken German forces in the West and support our allied actions in the East.\n\n     Thus, to successfully carry out this adventure, all aspects of the operation must be thoroughly worked out: choosing the optimal landing site, assessing enemy forces, and preparing the necessary resources for the subsequent offensive."

The Normandy landing represents a strategically sound step aimed at liberating French lands from German occupation. This action will not only demonstrate our resolve but also create conditions for further pressure on German forces.\n\n     However, given the scale of the upcoming operation, special attention must be paid to the threat of espionage. Maintaining the secrecy of this plan is critically important for the success of the operation.

Calls for peace negotiations with the German and Rhomean governments were heard during the debates. The Lord Protector, present at the session, attentively listened to his colleagues’ opinions, showing concern for the country’s future.\n\n     As a result of the heated debates, a conclusion was made about the need to gradually reduce the Confederation’s participation in the war.

He urged his colleagues to consider that further sacrifices might be in vain and only worsen the people's suffering.\n\n     During the debates, the lord raised the question of the consequences for the Confederation if it rejects the idea of separate peace. 'We must ask ourselves: are we ready to continue this mad struggle or is it time to end this bloodshed?' he said resolutely. His words sounded like a challenge: the choice before parliament was to try to conclude a separate peace with the enemies or continue fighting to the end, risking losing everything.

A series of emergency decisions were made aimed at modernizing factories and plants, increasing the production of military equipment and gear. One of the key slogans of the campaign became the phrase 'The future must arrive today,' emphasizing the importance of rapid changes and decisive actions.\n\n      This call should become a symbol of a new era in the British economy, uniting all social strata for the common goal – creating a more modern and efficient industrial base. Ultimately, the overtime work of workers, engineers developing new technologies, and the efforts and investments of entrepreneurs should yield results and, despite difficulties, this campaign should lay the foundation for further economic growth during the war and strengthen the position of the Confederation of the British Isles on the international stage."
