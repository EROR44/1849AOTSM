 scadip.2.t:0 "Northern Proposal"
 scadip.2.d:0 "Today a delegation from Scandinavia came to us with a very strange proposal. They want to help us in the war in exchange for the territories of Schleswig and Holstein. On one hand, things are not going well on the front, but on the other hand, our citizens live there.\nThe decision is now up to our leader, but it is clear that we need to respond quickly, or we will not get a second chance for this agreement."
 scadip.2.a:0 "We definitely need another ally"
 scadip.2.b:0 "An ally is good, but the land is more important!"

 scadip.3.t:0 "Germany Agrees"
 scadip.3.d:0 "To our surprise, the German side agreed to this deal. Now all the lands of Denmark are under our control, but we will have to fight alongside the Germans in this war. But what wouldn’t you do for a few provinces?"
 scadip.3.a:0 "Let's show their enemies the northern fury!"

 scadip.4.t:0 "Germany Refuses"
 scadip.4.d:0 "Germany gave a clear answer. They will not give us the lands, even if the enemies begin to sweep them away. This arrogance will surely be their downfall, but all we have to do is wait for the right moment to strike the weakened victor and take what rightfully belongs to us!"
 scadip.4.a:0 "Even so, we will succeed."

 scawar.4.t:0 "Maneuvers in the Northern Seas"
 scawar.4.d:0 "   Troubling news from the northern seas: there was a clash between our fleet and the Scandinavian fleet. Although the battle lasted only a few hours, it resulted in serious damage to both sides. \n\n    The Scandinavian side claims it was only an accident caused by crew error, but who knows what this will lead to in the future..."
