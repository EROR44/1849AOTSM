 abw.9.t:0 "Battle of Nancy, German victory"
 abw.9.d:0 "As soon as German forces began occupying former military positions in Alsace-Lorraine, the French command ordered an attack on these positions. The first hours of the battle resembled chaos, as no one understood what was happening, but by evening the positions stabilized. However, the French army did not expect the German Empire to send so many forces to these lands, which became a fatal miscalculation. Initially, France managed to capture part of the fortifications, but this was Germany’s plan, as the French forces were then surrounded and raised the white flag.\nThe German government is extremely dissatisfied with its neighbor’s behavior, so while losses were being counted, it sent an ultimatum to the French. It is obvious that after the defeat, they will accept it without hesitation."
 abw.9.a:0 "We crushed the hopes of the French, hopefully forever"
 abw.9.b:0 "Will this not be in history books?"
 abw.10.t:0 "Battle of Nancy, French victory"
 abw.10.d:0 "Before fully entering Alsace-Lorraine, the German army did not expect to meet French forces who immediately opened fire on the Germans. This unexpected maneuver determined the winner of the battle, which Germany tried to win by any means but was defeated.\nNow that the battle is over, it is clear that France will not leave these lands easily, putting Germany’s defense in a very disadvantageous position."
 abw.10.a:0 "The Kaiser will be very displeased with this news"
 abw.10.b:0 "Again we showed that Germany is weaker"
 adw.11.t:0 "Status Quo"
 adw.11.d:0 "Due to lack of government support, we cannot continue the conflict over Alsace-Lorraine. This is very sad news, as now we cannot defend our interests and must maintain the status quo.\nAs a result of government apathy, Germany rejoices in preserving the status quo; Alsace-Lorraine is now officially part of the German Empire. French forces are saddened that they cannot defend their interests."
 adw.11.a:0 "We managed to protect our interests"
 adw.11.b:0 "A mistake was made"
