Over the last decade, he has made a dizzying career, starting as a simple deputy in the latest session of the Paris government.\n\nHaving taken the post of head of government a year ago, the politician faced a complex situation. While the country was experiencing an overall economic upturn, it encountered internal difficulties. The defeat in the elections of Louis Napoleon led to many incidents; the 'favorite' of reactionary citizens provoked a series of problems that continue to destroy France from within."
