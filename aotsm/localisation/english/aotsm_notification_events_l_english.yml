 aotsm_notification_event.2.d:0 "Already few doubted that a major war in Europe could be avoided. The aggression of Prussia and Rhomeans, as well as French, Russian and British ambitions. All this was the reason for the outbreak of the world war.\nToday, many countries in Europe have already begun the process of mobilization, as well as preparations for the coming clashes. Now it is clear one thing none of the European powers is not going to just give up, which means that the war will be extremely brutal and bloody. Some experts say that this war will be the most destructive for Europe in history."

 aotsm_notification_event.3.d:0 "       Dear ladies and gentlemen! At this time we do not recommend playing for the country of your choice. We regret to inform you that the content of this country is unfinished or outdated, and therefore you are unlikely to get good impressions from the game.\n\n      We strongly recommend you to play for other, more developed countries: Confederation of British Isles, Russian State, Rhomean Empire or Prussia. And once again, ladies and gentlemen, §RNOT RECOMMENDED§! You should not play for this country!  \n\n                                                             Regards, AotSM development team"

 aotsm_notification_event.4.d:0 "       We inform you that in the current version of the mod, the scenario following the victory of the Austrian Empire in the 'Fratricidal Wars' is not implemented. This event marks the final point of the campaign, and further progression is not supported by the balance and mechanics.\n\n       We strongly advise against continuing the game beyond this point:\n- Unprepared scripts may cause errors or unstable behavior (up to the complete inability to continue the campaign).\n- Content (dialogues, events, mechanics) for the Austrian Empire and Prussia for this scenario is missing.\n\n       Full development of alternative scenarios is underway and will be added in future updates.\n\n                                                             Sincerely, the AotSM development team"
