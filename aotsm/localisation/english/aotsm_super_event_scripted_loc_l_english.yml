 GFX_aotsm_PRU_form_north_german_union_super_event_desc:0 "After Prussia's victory over Austria in the Fratricidal War, the North German Confederation was formed. Trends are already visible to replace the German Confederation with a confederation of regional states led by Prussia. The goal of this union is to unite the northern German states to strengthen their positions and prepare for further geopolitical tasks. The North German Confederation will be an important step on the path to Berlin's greatness."

 GFX_aotsm_PRU_form_german_empire_super_event_desc:0 "After the Second Fratricidal War, Prussia, under the leadership of a wise leader, began the process of unifying Germany. Victory over Austria allowed the annexation of several small German states and strengthened its influence in the region. A successful border clash with the regions of Alsace and Lorraine became the final chord in the unification of Germany. The creation of the German Empire was proclaimed. The unification of Germany under the Kaiser’s rule significantly affected the balance of power in Europe and determined the country's further development."

 GFX_aotsm_SAR_unite_italia_super_event_desc:0 "In the first half of the 19th century, the states of the Apennine Peninsula were under the control of other countries such as Austria and France.

Influenced by patriotic movements and leaders like Count Camillo Benso di Cavour, a series of actions aimed at unification began. As a result of successive campaigns, Italy was formed into a single state, ending centuries of division."

Clashes with the police have already begun."

The uprising aims to protect their rights, which have been questioned due to the consolidation of power in the Center. The Young Turks advocate limiting Constantinople’s power in the region and implementing a series of socio-economic reforms."

 GFX_aotsm_BYZ_death_of_emperror_super_event_desc:0 "The death of the Emperor shrouded the Romean Empire in an atmosphere of bitterness and loss, lending weight to every word and every tear.

However, beneath these discussions lurked anxieties — the intensity of passions foretold coming trials, and only the departed emperor knew what legacy he left behind: both greatness and a deep crack stretching through the heart of his people."

At the same time, news came from the Caucasus region about clashes on the Russo-Romean border. In light of these events, Russia’s allies began declaring full support and started mobilizing their troops, preparing to open the Western Front."

Germany, as a partner of Constantinople in the Pact, along with Russia’s allied countries, immediately entered the conflict, igniting the fire of the Great War."

Neither side wishes to negotiate. Apparently, this conflict will affect all of Europe, and perhaps the entire world..."

Members of the Continental Pact of Europe immediately came to Constantinople’s defense, while Russia’s allies mobilized soldiers and weapons in hopes of defeating the enemy trapped on two fronts. The best tacticians faced off on the battlefields, strategic minds on both sides sought paths to victory, and national pride, the desire for freedom, and the struggle for survival became the driving forces of the armies. The Great War will sweep across the continent, leaving marks that will forever change the course of history."
