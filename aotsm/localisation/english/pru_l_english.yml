Only in this way will Germany become great again! Let the Führer choose who will lead Germany after him! Machen wir Deutschland wieder groß!"
 PRU_question_about_army:0 "Question about the army"
 PRU_question_about_army_desc:0 "It is precisely the army of the German people that brought our faction to power; we owe what we have now to them. It would be extremely wise to encourage their endeavors since we not only share similar views but are also like-minded individuals who desire greatness for the German Reich for a thousand years or more!"
 PRU_army_is_main_power:0 "The army is Germany's main force"
 PRU_army_is_main_power_desc:0 "Undoubtedly, the army is the dominant faction in our country, and this is quite just - while Junkers, Kaisers, and various democrats try to weaken our mighty homeland, the army is doing its job instead of making impossible populist promises!

 PRU_grand_german_parad_desc:0 "Germany, cleansed from untermenschen, has become significantly stronger. To showcase the power we have gained after implementing our far-sighted policies, we should hold a parade throughout Germany - for us it will be a symbol of hope; for external and internal enemies - yet another reason to fear us."
 PRU_wellcome_to_hole:0 "Welcome to Hell"
 PRU_wellcome_to_hole_desc:0 "Enemies call our regime similar to Hell. This may well be true, but only for them. A true German will never let an enemy into his rear; he will destroy enemies of the true German people once and for all and will not sympathize with parasites living in the Reich's society - not at all! Instead, he will organize them a real Der Hölle on earth!"
 PRU_plan_o:0 "Plan 'O'"
 PRU_plan_o_desc:0 "Of course we do not expect that our government will unconditionally recognize German society tainted by its ties with parasites such as Jews, disabled individuals, monarchs, socialists, and Junkers; therefore it is rational to develop an action plan in case Plan 'O' is not fulfilled and a possible civil war arises. This plan has received a codename Plan 'O', but we would prefer not to reach a point where we need to implement a second plan."
 PRU_futer_of_socialist:0 "The Future of Socialists"
 PRU_futer_of_socialist_desc:0 "It is precisely socialists who constantly stand in the way of Germany's greatness and destroy it from within since their rhetoric aims at igniting civil war - they should be eradicated from Germany so that true Germans no longer kill each other over ideologies that lead people into terrible delusions."
 PRU_futer_of_reich:0 "The Future of the Reich"
 PRU_futer_of_reich_desc:0 "The Fatherland, freed from parasitic elements, has once again become a state that confidently looks into the future; socialists misleading true Germans and Junkers engaging in corruption - all this is in the past... The Reich will become great no matter what because our policies have already begun to bear fruit."
 PRU_futer_of_junker:0 "The Future of Junkers"
 PRU_futer_of_junker_desc:0 "Junkers are corruptors and remnants of an old criminal regime. We are confident that if they had a chance to sell off their country to other states, they would do it - this practically means they are traitorous Jews against Fatherland; therefore their punishment can only be one - death!"

And if we have practically sorted out political situations in the region, urgent reforms must begin regarding centralizing previously fragmented territories of the Second Reich that initially belonged to the German economic union."

Our country is not in the best condition right now; we can try to resist the Prussians, but this is a very risky step. The main condition of the ultimatum is that we COMPLETELY renounce our influence in northern Germany. What will our Kaiser do?"

Comparing our military power, we have no chance, but what if the French decide to help us?\nDue to the dire situation in the region, we need to urgently respond to the Prussians.

It is time to put an end to this issue, and thus it is time to start one last war against Austria.\nNow we face the question of whether to invite Byzantium for the division of Austrian lands.

Пока это все не сделано лидером страны станет наш монарх.\nНо главным вопросом все ещё является: кто это сделал?

Перед кайзером Фридрихом III было несколько вариантов конституции и ему осталось лишь выбрать и доработать одну из представленных.\nВ итоге кайзер выбрал конституцию, которая была основана на конституции Паульскирхена. Теперь власть кайзера уходит на второй план, а целью правительства становится обеспечить равенство в германском обществе, так же эта конституция закрепила женское избирательное право, что фактически уравняла мужчин и женщин в политическом плане внутри странны."

 ger.7.d:0 "After the death of Joseph Maria von Radovitz, a vacuum of power remains. Our citizens wish to take revenge on the murderers, while the elites are increasingly trying to consolidate their positions. But it is time to end this crisis before it becomes something more than just chaos in the Reichstag.\nOur Kaiser has shown himself well as the leader of the state, but will he be able to continue managing so effectively?"
 ger.7.a:0 "Let Bismarck prepare for a trip to the Reichstag."

 ger.8.t:0 "Split of the Autocrats' Bloc"
 ger.8.d:0 "As soon as it was announced that the Bloc of Autocrats had won, fierce disputes arose between the Junkers and monarchists, as no final leader had been determined. Therefore, in the morning, the bloc announced its split and the creation of two independent parties, namely the Revolutionary Party and the Monarchist Union.\nThe government has no time for new elections, as this may raise the level of radicalization again, which cannot be allowed; thus it was decided to hold secret debates in the Reichstag where the fate of Germany's leading party will be decided."
 ger.8.a:0 "Let Karl Anton lead our government."
 ger.8.b:0 "Better let the Kaiser temporarily take everything into his own hands."
 
 ger.9.t:0 "The Germans' Escape"
 ger.9.d:0 "As soon as German society declared us murderers of their leader, our local Germans immediately sided with them. Now there are discontented people within our country who believe that we 'allegedly' killed the leader of the German Empire, but that's not true.\nIt is now clear that most Germans are leaving our lands back to their homeland; what will happen to the rest is hard to say. Perhaps some will join radical organizations, some will start underground activities, or maybe some will defect back to Germany. In this story, one thing is clear: we have become scapegoats."
 ger.9.a:0 "The rats are fleeing from the ship."
 
 ger.10.t:0 "The Death of Frederick William IV"
 ger.10.d:0 "Today during his morning walk, Kaiser Frederick William IV felt unwell. At first, his entourage thought that he was just tired, but when his condition began to rapidly deteriorate, those accompanying him immediately went for doctors who were at the palace.\nBut when the doctor arrived, he could only confirm Frederick's death. Everyone was in shock as the Kaiser died in just 20 minutes. Preliminary reports indicate that death was due to a heart attack. This information was confirmed by his relatives since they knew that the Kaiser had long complained about heart pains.\nNow public opinion is divided; the government and the Kaiser’s family consider his death a natural process, but the people believe that he was poisoned by Russian agents. And once again public attention returned to the crisis associated with Joseph von Radovitz's death, but now this crisis has become much sharper as it involves both the death of the first Reich Chancellor and that of the first Kaiser."
 ger.10.a:0 "The era of old Germany has passed."
 
 ger.11.t:0 "Act of Surrender"
 ger.11.d:0 "After our cities were destroyed by German bombardment, we have no choice but to surrender. Our public is horrified by those events.\nThe Germans and Romans demand from us a huge number of concessions and land transfers. The main condition is also a renunciation of all colonial possessions and disbanding of our alliance.\nThere should have been debates regarding acceptance of this act, but we currently have too many problems. Therefore, without further ado, we will simply sign the act."

 ger.13.t:0 "Incident During Testing"
 ger.13.d:0 "During testing Leypoldite's destructive power an incident occurred that led to a Leypoldite leak in the active testing zone; therefore an order was given to evacuate from the island. Now no one can say what to expect."
 ger.13.a:0 "It turned out poorly."

 ger.14.t:0 "Temporary Monopoly"
 ger.14.d:0 "Now that the tank forces have passed the 'fire' tests, the government has decided to make concessions to the manufacturers. Currently, two manufacturers (conglomerates by region) lead in our country: the Berlin and Königsberg conglomerates. The Berlin one has decided to focus on heavy equipment production, such as tanks, while the Königsberg one is trying to engage in everything and a little bit of everything."

Now the road to French territories is open, and they will likely hesitate to respond to this act."
 ger.15.a:0 "How can they say they are not Germans?"

 ger.16.t:0 "Fraternization on the Front"
 ger.16.d:0 "Some of our experts said this could happen, but no one was prepared for the fact that fraternization could become so widespread. Right now, we simply have no opportunity to advance, so we can only endure this unpleasant event.\nThe King is already drafting a document stating that any soldier caught fraternizing will be equated with a traitor to the homeland. Such a radical decision will help us avoid this unpleasant phenomenon in the future. When Austria was advancing on southern German countries, they did not experience this problem, which means they do not consider themselves Germans!"

 ger.17.t:0 "Kingkaizer Generation 2 Ready"
 ger.17.d:0 "Today at the Prussian factory, a new version of the Kingkaizer tank model of the second generation was developed. It is based on the previous model, but this time the Berlin government decided to increase its reliability by using eight rollers on board with torsion suspension instead of a checkerboard layout, armor thickness of 10-15mm, and a hexagonal turret equipped with high commander's cupolas and a side evacuation hatch. To enhance firepower, this model will be equipped with a 75mm gun, with increased power achieved through projectile enhancement using Leypoldite. It seems that the green crystal can be applied in this way as well..."
 ger.17.a:0 "We are getting closer to the perfect tank."

 ger.18.t:0 "Kingkaizer Generation 3 Ready"
 ger.18.d:0 "Germany's military-scientific development seems unwilling to stop at what has been achieved; therefore rumors have reached the public that a new and seemingly perfect model of tank has been developed – Kingkaizer of the third generation. The main changes compared to previous generations were made to the turret, which was reinforced using multiple alloys; however, such a load cannot be supported by a weak hull, so it was also decided to change it – for the first time in German tank construction it has variable width; that is, the width of the lower part equals that of the hull. The upper part had to be widened using over-track sponsons; armor plate thickness varies: upper part - 80mm, rear - 80mm, front - 100mm. The thickness of the lower part was reduced to 63mm since here additional protection is provided by support rollers. Most armor plates connect at right angles, but a weak point is where the turret meets the hull since it is unprotected; however, few see such a problem as critical because Berlin has no competitors in tank construction."
 ger.18.a:0 "This is the pinnacle of our genius!"

 ger.19.t:0 "Weber Invests in Leypoldite Research University"
 ger.19.d:0 "Due to many properties of Leypoldite being beyond our understanding, Wilhelm Eduard Weber, a brilliant German physicist who contributed greatly to studying and developing Leypoldite, decided to create a university focused on this subject.\nConsidering many factors, ignoring such an obviously valuable material would be extremely wasteful – probably why the government did not interfere with this initiative.\nRegardless of anything else, one thing can be said for sure – Germany is becoming a center of scientific knowledge."

 ger.20.t:0 "Leypoldite is Key to the Future"
 ger.20.d:0 "In the recently opened university dedicated to Leypoldite research thanks to Weber's efforts, initial successes have already occurred. Through experiments, Justus von Liebig managed to discover that if we use a mixture of alcohol, soap, and paint and subject it all to thermal processing at high temperatures, then the material begins to glow unnaturally. However, there is bad news – apparently further experiments will not be safe..."
 ger.20.a:0 "So that's how it works."

 ger.21.t:0 "Prince Wilhelm has died on the battlefield!"
 ger.21.d:0 "First, there was fraternization on our side at the front, and now this letter. It seems that the Lord Himself is against this war, but after these events, we can no longer simply retreat.\nThe letter itself was a heavy blow to our dear King, for today he lost his brother. As stated in the letter, he personally led the troops into battle, wanting to earn the glory of Napoleon, but instead of glory, he received death. Today our homeland mourns the loss of Prince Wilhelm, who was also the heir.\nThe loss of an heir poses a serious threat to legitimate claims to the German throne; therefore, soon Wilhelm's son Friedrich will be appointed heir since our king has yet to have children."
 ger.21.a:0 "A tragedy for the entire nation!"

 ger.22.t:0 "Prince Wilhelm has passed away!"
 ger.22.d:0 "After sustaining an injury while preparing for war with Austria, the health of Crown Prince Wilhelm began to deteriorate rapidly. Now, those closest to the prince have gathered around him, many realizing they are hearing him for the last time.\nHis son Friedrich has already been informed that after his father's death he will become prince and heir to Wilhelm Friedrich IV's throne if the latter does not have children."

 ger.23.t:0 "A Genius by the Name of Krupp"
 ger.23.d:0 "Alfred Krupp, born in 1812 in Essen, is truly a genius German industrialist and inventor and is likely to become a major supplier of weapons...\n\nHe first demonstrated his ingenuity long ago - taking over a company in 1826 with only seven employees and an initial capital of 10,000 thalers; 14-year-old Alfred did not give up and thanks to further development of railway transport in Europe, by 1836 Krupp already employed 60 people. Alfred Krupp has cared for his workers throughout his life by introducing health insurance and building apartments for them. In return, he demanded their loyalty to the firm.\n\nIn 1838, Krupp patented rollers for producing steel spoons and forks. In subsequent years he traveled throughout Europe (wherever a German could go) in search of clients. And although the firm is undoubtedly expanding, it is constantly under threat of bankruptcy. In Lower Austria, he founded the Berndorf metal goods factory with banker and entrepreneur Alexander Scheler for producing silver cutlery and later from an 'alpaca' alloy. Upon returning Alfred to his Fatherland, he handed it over to his brother Hermann.\n\nInitially, arms production was a hobby for Krupp - after seven years of experiments with Leypoldite he manually cast the first barrel of a rifle. The first attempts to sell this firearm were unsuccessful as military forces still trusted time-tested bronze more; in their opinion, steel is too close to iron and Leypoldite is not fully understood and unlikely to be contained by such a fragile metal - military personnel believed such weapons would be unsuitable for future military confrontations.\n\nIn 1847, Krupp cast the first Leypoldite steel cannon which was presented to the Prussian War Ministry for review but it was decided to hand it over to the arsenal."

 ger.24.t:0 "A Genius by the Name of Siemens"
 ger.24.d:0 "Werner von Siemens was born on December 13, 1816, in Lenthe near Hanover. He was the fourth child out of 14 in farmer Christian-Ferdinand's family and his wife. After their parents' death at age 24, Werner became the oldest in a family consisting of brothers and sisters.\n\nIn 1845 he became one of the most notable young scientists in the recently established Physical Society and already in the following year he was assigned to a general staff commission for preparing electrical telegraphy implementation. In a letter dated December 14, 1846, Werner Siemens informed his relatives: 'I am now almost resolved to choose a permanent career in telegraphy... Telephony will become an independent and even more important branch of technology, and I feel called upon to play a role as its organizer.'\n\nOn October 1, 1847, together with mechanic Johann Halske he founded the telegraph construction firm Telegraphenbauanstalt Siemens & Halske (S&H), which dealt not only with electrical telegraphy but also with studying ways to apply Leypoldite in this field along with a wide range of precision mechanics and optics work as well as creating electromechanical products. This firm had already begun constructing a telegraph line from Berlin to Frankfurt am Main using lead pipes for cables as well as gutta-percha insulation applied using a press invented by Siemens. It seems that Werner does not plan to stop at what has been achieved; he has already stated that thanks to Leypoldite it is now possible to create wireless communication – technology Richtungen ausstrahlen (Richausslen)."

 ger.25.t:0 "Wöhler Leaves Our Country"
 ger.25.d:0 "Friedrich Wöhler, one of the theorists on applying chemical Leypoldite technologies, left the country in anger over having his joint work with Justus von Liebig handed over to military officials for military benefit.\n\nThis vividly characterizes him as not very patriotic... But the most frightening thing is that such an event will inspire many scientists to flee from the country – this is unacceptable! Especially under current conditions..."
 ger.25.a:0 "This is his decision."

 ger.26.t:0 "The Fate of Austria"
 ger.26.d:0 "After the defeat in the last fratricidal war, the Austrians seem to have decided not to tempt fate and no longer shed German blood. In Austria itself, a weak but still present resistance has emerged – not everyone believes that religious contradictions are so fatal, yet even such a seemingly minor issue can cause a rift among Germans.\nFor this reason, a question has arisen in the Reichstag about what should be done with the captured territories: some express the thought that during the upcoming upheavals, rapid integration is the best solution, as it would allow us to acquire more human resources and industry; if there are those who resist, we will have to show everyone who is in charge. Others oppose this approach, believing it will only lead to greater losses and more spilled German blood, as well as divert attention to suppressing resistance, which is clearly undesirable. Therefore, they propose to engage in gradual integration of Austrian lands.\nWhatever happens, one thing is certain – the oppression of the Habsburg dogs will no longer be tolerated by the peoples of Europe..."

But it had many potential enemies in the form of the Habsburg tyranny from the south, leftists and dictators from the west, and barbarians from the east. The first fell due to Berlin's power in the last fratricidal war, while others watched in horror as they united into an alliance opposing the European Continental Pact.\nNow the Second Reich faces serious challenges – it seems that a great war in Europe is just around the corner...."

We cannot just sit idly by; we have already allowed them to destroy Holland and Belgium. We cannot allow further insults to us.\nBut on the other hand, recently Germans have been busy with war and preparations for it.

 ger_answer.21.a:0 "We are glad that they maintain humanity in these tough times."

 ger_answer.22.t:0 "France Refuses the Truce"
 ger_answer.22.d:0 "The French have refused us a truce even on such a holy holiday as Christmas. This only proves that there is nothing sacred among these frogs!\nThey intend to fight no matter what. In this case, rather than trying to make contact with them, it would be better to strengthen our pressure on the western border!"
 ger_answer.22.a:0 "No respect for soldiers."

 ger_warplane.1.t:0 "Military Conflict Strategy"
 ger_warplane.1.d:0 "Today our military command is buzzing: we need to choose a military plan for future conflicts. Many would like to avoid them, but a major war in Europe seems increasingly likely... According to available information, Rome plans to start a war with Russia by 57, which will likely be supported by the British. We cannot deny the possibility of intervention from the French as well. Therefore, we need to decide which strategy we should adhere to.\n\nThree main action plans have been proposed for discussion, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, but each is merely a general recommendation for action. Still, we need to develop a real action plan, but it is better to have a foundation than to enter into conflict without one.\n\nEach plan belongs to different gentlemen: Friedrich Wrangel, Karl Nikolaus, and Otto von Bismarck."
 ger_warplane.1.a:0 "Let’s hear them."

 ger_warplane.2.t:0 "Nikolaus's Plan"
 ger_warplane.2.d:0 "Nikolaus slowly ascended to the podium for his speech. As he climbed, he could not help but notice the stern gaze of the Kaiser, the cold stare of Bismarck, and the cheeky smile of Wrangel. As soon as he reached the podium, he began his speech:\n\n– I believe it is best to wait out the winter and launch a summer offensive. – Nikolaus spoke uncertainly. – If we send our soldiers into battle during winter, we will simply lose them. We cannot allow meaningless losses at the start of the war.\n\n– And what do you want to say? – interrupted Kaiser Friedrich Wilhelm I – Do you mean that our great warriors should burrow into the ground like cowardly moles? Or what do you propose?\n\n– Well... uh... how should I put it... - Nikolaus continued even more uncertainly. – I meant to say... that we will not undertake major offensives during winter so as not to lose troops. Then when the weather allows, we will launch a major offensive and crush our enemies with one blow.\n\n– Your uncertainty reflects very poorly on your plan. – said Friedrich. – What do Friedrich Wrangel and Otto Bismarck think about this plan?\n\n– I believe that if we allow our enemies to unite their forces, it will be the end of our great army. – Wrangel said with a smirk.\n\n– There is some sense in Nikolaus's words, but no backbone. The plan may be good, but his demeanor... It’s a disgrace for a Prussian. – Bismarck coldly commented. – But still, I would add that I and perhaps Wrangel can offer much better plans."
 ger_warplane.2.a:0 "The plan is interesting; next."

 ger_warplane.3.t:0 "Wrangel's Plan"
 ger_warplane.3.d:0 "Before speaking, Wrangel looked at Nikolaus with pity. The young and inexperienced one had no chance against orators like Wrangel or Bismarck. But even with this pity, as he approached the podium, Wrangel radiated confidence and charisma. As soon as he was at the podium, he took a slow breath and began:\n\n– Esteemed command and beloved Kaiser. – He began quickly and confidently as if he had practiced his speech all night long. – I want to propose a plan for a massive assault. Our great Reich has enough soldiers and equipment. Why should we wait? We can simply sweep away our enemies!\n\n– Perhaps we have enough equipment, but the combined armies of France, Britain, and Russia will be two or more times larger than ours. – Friedrich Wilhelm I sharply interrupted him. – Wrangel are you so sure that we can break the backs of three European giants with a quick attack?\n\n– Well... yes. We are Germany, formerly Prussia! Who defeated Napoleon's 'Great' army? We did! – It was evident that at first Wrangel had a shadow of doubt but quickly pushed it aside. – Are there people here who fear the French, British or Russians? We ended Austria; in its time it was one of the strongest in Europe. And at worst case scenario we have Rome ready to give its life for one of our soldiers.\n\n– It seems you are confident in our army; however, don't you think this plan is more like just saying: 'To battle'? – commented the Kaiser. – I wouldn't want to just send Germany's sons into an attack without a clear plan. So? Wrangel do you have anything else to say?\n\n– Yes, Kaiser... I have something to say. – once again filled with confidence began Wrangel.\n\n– Enough of this nonsense. – The Kaiser interrupted him again. – I am tired of listening to you all. Nikolaus, Bismarck what are your thoughts?\n\n– I think you are right Kaiser... He just wants to kill our army in a frontal assault... Without an ounce of tactics... - Nikolaus mumbled uncertainly.\n\nBismarck preferred to remain silent as he understood that remaining quiet was currently the best decision.\n\n– Nikolaus, yes I... - Wrangel wanted to start.\n\n– Quiet! – The Kaiser interrupted him again. – Today's meeting is over.\n\nThe hall began to disperse silently; only in Wrangel's eyes was visible resentment towards Nikolaus, but he did what he wanted; namely avenged that mockery."
 ger_warplane.3.a:0 "There is some sense in his words; next."

 ger_warplane.4.t:0 "Bismarck's Plan"
 ger_warplane.4.d:0 "The time has come for Bismarck. He did not even attempt to approach the podium and began from his seat:\n\n – War with Russia is suicide. – Bismarck said coldly – But I...\n\n – Yes, how you... - Friedrich Wilhelm I wanted to interrupt him.\n\n – Be quiet! Either you listen to me now, or watch YOUR Germany crumble! – Bismarck said with an unusual ferocity. – I am ready to offer us a way not to win, but at least have a chance to defeat the Russians. Of course, if it were solely my will, we would do everything to instill false values in the Russians. We would undermine unity among their elites. And then we would just watch as this decaying state falls apart over time.\n\nBismarck paused briefly to survey the entire hall, which was eagerly awaiting the continuation of his speech. Even the Kaiser, whom Bismarck had silenced, was waiting for something—perhaps he was waiting for the end of the speech to execute Bismarck for his audacity, or maybe the Kaiser truly understood that only he could lead Germany to victory.\n\n – So here it is. To win, we do not need a large offensive or anything else. – Bismarck said, looking into the soul of everyone in the hall. – Our plan consists of small attacks, but we must hit hard and painfully. We will start with France; what is its weakness? It is its unwillingness for war, which means that to defeat them we simply need to show them all the horrors of war. If they dare to enter into war with us. The British... Yes, it will be tough with them, but Wrangel rightly pointed out that we have an ally in Rome. As far as I know, Rome's fleet is larger and more modern than Britain's fleet; thus we will use their fleet to achieve victory at sea. But the British weakness lies in their love for Cromwell; if even one important politician doubts him, they will immediately exit the war to resolve the problem of a new uprising. The Chartists have clearly demonstrated Britain's weakness.\n\nOnce again Bismarck took a pause. This time to take his favorite Roman cigar. As soon as the cigar was lit, he continued.\n\n – Now Russia poses a very serious problem. – Bismarck began again, occasionally pausing for his cigar. – As all past wars with Russia have shown, they have an invisible ally: Russian winter; therefore preparation of soldiers for harsh winters must be included in our plan for victory. But our main weapon against Russia should be its own elites, who we must turn to our side before the war begins. They currently have an entire German autonomy; it would be good if during the war they raised uprisings for our ideals. Still, I do not have a clear plan for victory; I have steps that we MUST take to at least avoid losing. So, does anyone have anything to say?\n\nAs soon as Bismarck finished, the entire hall erupted in applause. Today Bismarck not only saved his life but also proved to everyone that he is indeed the future of Germany."
 ger_warplane.4.a:0 "Maybe Bismarck is right..."

 ger_warplane.5.t:0 "Final Choice of Plan for Future Wars"
 ger_warplane.5.d:0 "And so the hall has listened to all three Field Marshals. The most difficult part remains: choosing a plan. Each plan has its pros and cons; therefore it is impossible to say which plan is better. Now three eyes are on the Kaiser while their plans lie before him... The Kaiser decided to read each one once more to make a final choice.\n\nNikolaus's Plan – a plan for a summer offensive. His speech was uncertain but at the same time this plan could allow us to preserve soldiers.\n§GMain Pros:§!\n - We will have a huge bonus for summer offensives.\n - We will help young blood take positions in the army.\n§tMain Cons:§!\n - We will still be adversely affected by winter.\n - We will only have one chance.\n\nWrangel's Plan – a plan for massive assault. Wrangel is an old-school military man, but his ambitions have become very dangerous in recent years. In his plan we win even before our enemies realize what is happening.\n§GMain Pros:§!\n - We will receive huge bonuses at the start of the war.\n§tMain Cons:§!\n - A slow advance may jeopardize the plan.\n - We still suffer during winter.\n\nBismarck's Plan – an internal destruction strategy. Bismarck proposes waging war not directly but from within. It’s hard to assess all strengths and weaknesses of this plan since such strategies are rarely used in wars.\n§GMain Pros:§!\n - We won’t be affected by winters.\n§tMain Cons:§!\n - We won’t have any special bonuses during the war."
 ger_warplane.5.a:0 "Still Nikolaus's arguments were better."
 ger_warplane.5.b:0 "Wrangel's ambitious plan is the best choice."
 ger_warplane.5.c:0 "We cannot disobey Bismarck."

 ger_warplane.6.t:0 "Wrangel's Plan"
 ger_warplane.6.d:0 "And now war has come to Europe’s lands. Wrangel is already ready to take command and maximize his plan's effectiveness. The other military leaders have already transferred command authority over all German Wehrmacht forces to him.\nReports from our warehouses and combat units indicate that we will not face supply issues. But we must remember that we need to finish this war quickly; we do not have the right or strength to prolong this conflict."
 ger_warplane.6.a:0 "For the Kaiser! For the Fatherland! And for Wrangel!"

 ger_warplane.7.t:0 "Bismarck"
 ger_warplane.7.d:0 "And so the war began...\nBismarck sat in his office reading reports on the state of armed forces when Nikolaus and Wrangel entered his office and informed him that war had already started. After that, Bismarck quickly gathered himself and went out to the square in front of the Reichstag where he delivered a speech.\nNow Commander-in-Chief Bismarck is signing decrees about opening pre-prepared warehouses and starting operations in hostile countries. It has now become clear that Bismarck's plan worked even before the war began since all supply lines had been adapted for this new conflict."
 ger_warplane.7.a:0 "The main thing is that winter won't affect us."
