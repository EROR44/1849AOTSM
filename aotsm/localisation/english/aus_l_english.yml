But then unexpectedly one of the guards came in and said:\n – “Louis, the President of Austria wishes to speak with you.” – the guard clearly did not expect such guests today. – “The Austrian embassy didn’t say he was coming... And also...”\n – “Enough, Pierre, let our guest come in,” Louis said with a kind smile.\n       After that, the guard nodded and within 2 minutes there were two Napoleons in the cabin: Louis Napoleon and Napoleon François Joseph Charles Bonaparte. Charles slowly surveyed his cousin’s cabin and then said:\n- “You’ve settled in well here. Things are very bad for us in Austria, but today I didn’t come to ask for help, but to discuss something.” – Joseph was clearly excited, which made his speech fast. – “So, remember my father? Well... I was recently in Corsica... And... Father is coming.”\n        After these words, Napoleon Bonaparte entered the cabin slowly, the very one who lost in 1806. As soon as Louis realized who he saw, he immediately replied: - “Joseph, may the Virgin curse you. You know the French hate him?” – Louis’s calm was gone. – “He could just be executed... Did you even think about the risk of you two being here?”\n       While Louis tried to reach Joseph, Napoleon slowly approached the window and said:\n – “It seems to me that after your work, Louis... My disgrace is repaired.” – Napoleon began to speak slowly and thoughtfully. – “You know, after the horrors of socialism, I think the people will accept me... Yes Louis, I would like to ask you to abdicate in my favor.”\n      After these words, Louis simply fell into his chair and could not recover for several hours... But who knows what he ultimately chose."

When they entered, they found Bonaparte’s lifeless body. When the doctor arrived, he reported that death was caused by heart failure, likely related to the leader’s age.\n       After this, news of Napoleon’s death spread first through the palace and then throughout Paris. It became known that as soon as the news reached Napoleon’s son, he decided to travel to France the same day. Napoleon’s will was also found, in which he transferred power in France back to Louis, believing his son would be satisfied with Austria."
