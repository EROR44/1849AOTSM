Such an unexpected decision to declare war may spoil our plans for an advance eastward.\n        On one hand, we must honor our alliance duty, but on the other, are we obliged to die for Hungarian lands?"

 hun_answer.4.t:0 "[BYZ.GetName] Refused Us!"

 hun_answer.5.t:0 "Banat Will Be Returned to Us"

Now we need to begin the processes of reintegrating Banat and the coronation of Konstantin Zachareas.\n     Preparations for the coronation have already begun in Budapest. Also, the government archive has started searching for documents on Banat territory to make the integration smoother and more peaceful."

 hun_answer.6.t:0 "Banat Will Not Be Returned to Us"
