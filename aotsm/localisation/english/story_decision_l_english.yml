  story_decision_main.1.t:0 "General History"
 story_decision_main.1.d:0 "A turning point for the history of the Balkans, and indeed the world in general, was the failure of the Turkish expansion beyond the Bosporus and the Dardanelles. The weakened and devastated Byzantium managed to outlast its opponent and preserve peace in the Balkans for future generations.\nAs a result of preserving the 'Crystal Empire,' trade between Europe and Asia was not interrupted, and the turnover of goods between the states of the two regions not only did not decrease but in many ways grew. Because of this, arguments about the necessity of finding a route to India via Columbus's West were shattered, and Christopher himself until his death in 1514 tried to gain consent for funding the expedition, starting from the Castilian, Aragonese, and Portuguese kings, passing by the English and French, and even reaching the Norwegian kings and the Venetian Doge.\nThe Age of Great Maritime Discoveries began in the 1520s when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama attempted to sail around Africa from the south to find an alternative route to India. In 1519, his expedition began from Lisbon, and by 1521 he reached India and the city of Calicut, returning to Portugal in 1523 with proof in the form of spices. The incredible success of Gama inspired many Portuguese sailors to repeat his journey. In the 1520s, the first factories appeared on the African coast, the first being the factory at the Cape of Good Hope.\nIn the following years, other major European countries joined the trade and exploration of lands along the sea route around Africa. Spain with expeditions of Bartolome Ferre and Thomas de Berlanga, as well as Great Britain and France with smaller expeditions. Colonization of Africa was pointless, so many factories arose on the western, southern, and eastern coasts."

 story_decision_country.1.t:0 "History of the Prussian Kingdom"
 story_decision_country.1.d:0 "The history of Prussia begins in 1657 when, by the Treaty of Wehlau-Bydgoszcz, the state officially became independent from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After these events, the Elector of Prussia tried to start the process of uniting Germany around Berlin rather than Vienna.\nIn 1701, Prussia officially became a kingdom, thus becoming a serious player in Central European affairs. Throughout the 18th century, the kingdom rapidly expanded its territories and strengthened its authority. Also, by the end of the century, work began on a new military doctrine that later greatly helped Prussia during the Napoleonic Wars.\nHaving emerged victorious from the War of the Third Coalition, Prussia, basking in the laurels of victory, became proud. Initially, the inventions of Leipoldt and their safe production contributed to this. Even after the victory, German engineers and commanders continued to improve the new doctrine, which would later be called 'Blitzkrieg.' However, by 1840, tensions in Central Europe began to rise rapidly, so both Prussian and Austrian forces immediately tried to dominate various regions.\nBut two years later, it became clear that no country could gain a serious advantage, as revolutionary forces proved much more organized than government ones. The result was the 1848 revolution, called the March Revolution, when the German Nations Union was formed, but due to Austria's attempt to invade southern Germany, creating a unified state became impossible. The Prussian king, now emperor of all Germany, constantly demanded Austria withdraw its troops, but each such attempt was ignored. By 1849, Prussia’s patience ran out, and preparations began for military action against Austria for regional dominance.\nNow Prussia has fully transitioned to military tracks. The idea in the minds of every citizen is: to fight Austria. All countries watching the region can feel the full power of the growing military machine; the question is whether it will become dominant or collapse like a house of cards?"

 story_decision_country.2.t:0 "History of the Romean Empire"
 story_decision_country.2.d:0 "The history of Romea nearly ended in 1341 when a civil war began in the weakened empire, but the emergence of a military leader who united the nation helped end the civil war by 1344. The three years of civil war caused minimal damage to both infrastructure and population. From 1346, the Empire decided to focus on the enemy from Asia, namely the Turkish hordes. Also, the emperor’s ideas helped mitigate the effects of the plague of 1347-1348. After these events, full strengthening of border forts and castles began to prevent the Turks from entering Europe. Therefore, even after the earthquake of 1354, the fortifications were not severely damaged, which led to the Turkish army’s defeat in the lands of the Gallipoli peninsula. Victory over the external enemy allowed Romea to continue the process of overcoming the schism, which led to the conclusion of the 'Holy Pact,' whose essence was that the Empire could not seize Balkan lands, but Catholic states should help return lands in Asia.\nThe 15th century began the process of returning Asian lands to the state. But the pact could have been broken in 1434 when Romea tried to invade Bulgaria but withdrew after warnings. At the end of the century, the unthinkable happened: the Romean-Russian war due to the religious split between Muscovy and Romea.\nThe 16th century became the cultural century of the Empire, as all emperors of that time sought to build as many churches, theaters, and schools as possible. The century was also marked by increased efforts by Romea to overcome the schism.\nThe 17th century continued the Empire’s history of military victories, namely the conquest of Mesopotamia, Judea, and active support of the Coptic uprising
 
  story_decision_country.3.t:0 "History of the Second French Republic"
 story_decision_country.3.d:0 "Prussia’s entry into the War of the Third Coalition predetermined France’s defeat. After losing the Battle of Jena, the French army was forced to retreat; subsequent battles were also unsuccessful for Napoleon. The overall decline in army morale, as well as the dire financial situation of the state, only worsened the situation, ultimately leading the French government to sign a peace treaty with the Coalition countries in 1806.\n\nThe war ended in defeat for the French. Losing Alsace and Lorraine and paying huge reparations, France had to deal with post-war devastation.\n\nRestoring the country’s economy took considerable time, but by 1816, the economy was largely stabilized. The government’s extraordinary powers, extended over these years, came to an end. On November 9, 1816, Jacques René Hébert announced his resignation.\n\nThe first elected head of government was Cyrille Lepage. As a candidate from the left-liberal party, he won 51.6% of the vote, leaving no chance for his opponents. Under his leadership, France continued its course toward economic strengthening and for the first time in a long while began conducting an independent foreign policy.\n\nIn the 1830s, the country experienced rapid industrial growth. The economy, which had caught up with pre-war levels several years earlier, accelerated thanks to trade and particularly the “Seay Agreement” signed with several countries. This agreement later even saved the country from an overproduction crisis.\n\nBy 1849, the country was undergoing a political crisis. The struggle in the last elections between Charles Lagrange and Louis Napoleon ended with the latter’s defeat. This created a series of precedents showing the resolute stance of militarists. Conflicts between the new head of government and reactionary circles created general instability in the country, dividing the French people."

 story_decision_country.4.t:0 "History of the Russian State"
 story_decision_country.4.d:0 "At the end of the 15th century, conflict began to brew between the Tsardom of Moscow and the Romean Empire. The causes of rivalry were the religious conflict between the Russian and Romean Orthodox churches, as well as a personal conflict between ruling dynasties. The campaign to Tsargrad, despite initial successes, was extremely unsuccessful for the Russians, leading to defeat and the removal of symbols of past victories from the walls of Constantinople. From that moment, Russia and Romea began their rivalry for dominance over the Black Sea and other regions, and Orthodoxy was finally split into Romean and Muscovite branches.\nIn July 1652, tensions flared again between Moscow and Constantinople, this time due to religious reforms by the Moscow Patriarch Nikon, proclaiming Church Slavonic as the sole true canon — the Patriarch of Constantinople refused to accept and deemed them heretical. Under Peter I, serfdom was finally established. Uprisings became more frequent. Alexander Romanov’s reign began at a very difficult time — the War of the Third Coalition against Napoleon Bonaparte’s forces. The young emperor supported the coalition, sending a 120,000-strong expeditionary corps under the command of Mikhail Kutuzov. Despite this, even his military talent could not turn the tide of battle. Napoleon Bonaparte, as a gesture of reconciliation, decided to send Russian prisoners of war back to Russia.\nFrom the 18th century, the country strategically needed land access to the Great Silk Road, prompting Emperor Alexander to wage war against the Kazakh Khanate. The offensive in Central Asia was condemned by Romea. Commander of Russian troops during the Central Asian campaign was Nikolai Nikolaevich Raevsky. At its start, in 1820-1821, Raevsky’s troops held the initiative and occupied the central part of the Kazakh Khanate, but due to strong local resistance and rampant corruption in the Tsar’s army, the offensive capacity was exhausted by spring 1822. Muslim rulers of Central Asia seized this opportunity and, to the surprise of many international observers, united against the Russians, signing allied agreements in Tashkent in March 1822 and setting aside their differences, at least temporarily. In July 1822, the Russian army was defeated and left Almaty, leading to a disgraceful retreat from Central Asia and damaging Russia’s international reputation. As a result of the campaign’s failure, General Raevsky was dismissed, and the Russian nobility suffered a severe blow, leading to growing discontent among all social strata.\nIn 1816, the secret society “Union of Salvation” was founded. Two years later, it transformed into the “Union of Prosperity,” counting over 200 members and adopting a more resolute stance. In 1821, the “Union of Prosperity” dissolved itself, giving rise to the “Northern” and “Southern” secret societies, whose leaders had revolutionary programs. They hoped to seize power via a military coup in the capital, supported by the provinces."

  story_decision_country.5.t:0 "History of the Confederation of the British Isles"
 story_decision_country.5.d:0 "English history begins to diverge from reality in 1553, when several English trading ships mistakenly sailed into the mouth of the Dvina River, where Arkhangelsk is located today, and were warmly received and later accepted by the Russian Tsar. The following year, a Russo-English trade agreement was signed, and in 1555 the processes to establish the Moscow Company began. This laid the foundations for trade relations between the two states, which would later grow into important commercial ties.\nThe 16th century was also marked by expeditions to Asia, initiated by the Portuguese. They arrived at the shores of Japan in 1542, and in 1580 began active trade with the Japanese Empire, although trade was partially suspended in 1637 due to a shogunate uprising. Why did Portuguese trade routes become so important? It’s simple: the CBI and Portugal were always friends, even after Cromwell came to power their relations only strengthened, so any Portuguese or English trade route became common to both countries.\nThe 17th century was a turning point in the new history of the CBI. In 1640, the English Civil War began, which in 1649 transformed into the First English Republic, and later in 1653 into Cromwell’s Protectorate. Once Cromwell solidified his power, he launched a punitive campaign against Ireland, resulting in the defeat of Irish armed forces and the incorporation of Ireland into the Confederation. At the same time, a religious conflict in Europe ended, which finally fragmented the Holy Roman Empire and equalized Catholics and Protestants. After these events, Cromwell began to devise a way to separate British religion from the continent, thus starting the transition from Protestantism to Anglicanism.\nThe 18th century was initially very calm, but by the middle of it, Europeans became actively interested in colonialism, as the “New World” was finally discovered, now called Cromwelland. The CBI was one of the main colonizers of the New World, but by the end of the century, as Napoleon rose in Europe, Austrians joined the British, establishing colonies in the Amazon and South Cromwelland.\nThe 19th century became the beginning of the end for the CBI, as every Lord Protector of this era was remembered as the worst in the Confederation’s history. In 1834, the position of Lord Protector was taken by William Lamb, a representative of the liberal movement in the CBI, who began the transition from dictatorship to a more democratic system. This greatly displeased the British elites. His unwise reforms led to an economic collapse, leaving over 20% of Britons homeless and about 50% unemployed. Attempts to remove Lamb from office were thwarted by Edward Smith-Stanley’s intervention. The situation in the CBI is now dire, starting with Lamb’s economic collapse, continuing with the dominance of the old guard in government and the army, loss of valuable scientific personnel, and most sadly, the obsolescence of military doctrine, as after the Coalition Wars, the Confederation adopted a bill on the immutability of tactics and strategy... Will William Lamb, who survived a stroke in 1848, be able to gather new people around him and save the CBI, or will his successors have to do so? This is the question you must answer."

 story_decision_country.6.t:0 "History of the Russian State"
 story_decision_country.6.d:0 "After the death of Alexander Pavlovich and the beginning of the interregnum, secret societies decided to oppose the new emperor, leading to an open uprising in December 1825. The conspirators sought to exploit the complex legal situation regarding the throne’s succession after the emperor’s death. On one hand, there was a secret document confirming Constantine Pavlovich’s renunciation of the throne, making Nicholas the heir. However, after reading it in the Senate, Nicholas did not recognize the document as valid without Constantine’s confirmation.\nOn November 27, 1825, the population was sworn allegiance to Constantine, and formally a new emperor appeared in Russia. When Constantine learned that Nicholas refused to accept the throne without confirmation of his renunciation, he was forced to go to St. Petersburg to resolve this unfortunate misunderstanding.\nOn December 14, a Decembrist uprising occurred in the capital due to the new emperor’s failure to appear in St. Petersburg. The state of uncertainty lasted a long time.\nBy 11 a.m. on December 14, Decembrist officers (staff captains of the guard Alexander Bestuzhev, Mikhail Bestuzhev, Dmitry Shchepin-Rostovsky) led about 800 soldiers of the Moscow Life Guard Regiment, joined by Alexander Yakubovich with sailors and the Izmailovsky Regiment, later by a company of the Life Guard Grenadier Regiment under Lieutenant Alexander Sutgof, and later by the newly appointed dictator Trubetskoy, who brought the guard cavalry, life grenadiers, and the Finnish regiment. During several hours of “silent confrontation,” only a few random shots were fired into the air. Unable to bear the tension, representing the government forces, Nicholas Pavlovich personally appeared on the square to avoid unnecessary casualties and preserve his reputation. As a result of the meeting with the rebels and under pressure from the situation, he signed a document renouncing the throne should he become the all-Russian emperor.\nOn December 16, Constantine, unaware of the situation in the capital, arrived in St. Petersburg. Seeing the city in the hands of the Decembrists, he decided to confirm his renunciation, finding no other way out. Due to the refusal of both claimants to the throne to reign, the Senate decided to satisfy the Decembrists’ demands.\nFollowing reforms after the December events, the Russian Empire became a presidential republic, where the head of state was elected by the People’s Assembly, though the term of office was never defined. The first president of the renewed state was Prince Sergey Petrovich Trubetskoy. However, due to the continued strong influence of the nobility, most promised reforms never came to fruition.\nIn March 1825, a unified code of laws of the Russian state was adopted with significant amendments authored by S.P. Trubetskoy, cementing the Decembrists’ political uncertainty.\nIn early 1830, under pressure from his circle and due to the difficult internal situation, Trubetskoy resigned and retired with honors. The new president was Ivan Ivanovich Pushchin, who inherited a state full of problems."

This allowed him to gain an important military rank rapidly, making his participation in the War of the First Coalition unquestioned.\n\n                               <<War of the First Coalition (1792 – 1797)>>\n\n                                                         <1792>\n\n     The main focus of this year was the Netherlands. Initially, the French forces had little success there, which led to a temporary shift of military actions to Champagne. The result was the retreat of coalition forces behind the Rhine, and France began establishing pro-French governments in the occupied territories. After these successes, it was decided to resume the campaign in the Netherlands. This time, success was with Paris, and the French managed to consolidate their lands. The last battlefield of 1792 was Savoy, but by early 1793 neither side achieved significant success.\n\n                                                          <1793>\n\n     The military campaign began in the recently captured part of the Netherlands, from where the French were again pushed out by combined Prussian and Austrian forces. Thus, this territory was lost again to the French. After victory in the region, Prussian forces attempted to push coalition enemies back from the Rhine but achieved little success. In 1793, the campaign in Spain began. Initially, neither side could gain the upper hand, but after the Spanish army was led by Ricardos, French forces suffered defeat after defeat. However, Ricardos suddenly died at the end of 1793, preventing Spain from turning the tide. Important naval battles between the French and English fleets also occurred this year. The result was several failed English landings and near-total destruction of the French fleet."

Although the Dutch tried to use their secret weapon (flooding), the result was the creation of the Batavian Republic on these lands. France gained not only an 'ally' but also a fleet that could replace the one lost the previous year. The front on the Rhine was of little interest to both coalition and French forces, so there were no significant changes. After Ricardos’s death, France decided to press Spain with all available means to free forces for the Italian front. As a result, Spanish forces lost Catalonia. Only by the end of 1794 did France partially restore its fleet, so it spent the year repelling English landings.\n\n                                                          <1795>\n\n      The 1795 military campaign began at the Rhine. The initial plan of the anti-French forces was to cross the river, but it failed, and seeing this, the French decided to conclude the Treaty of Basel with Prussia, by which all lands on the left bank passed to France, and Prussia exited the war. This treaty prompted the Prussian government to seriously reform the army and prepare tactics against Napoleon. On the Spanish front, a separate peace was concluded, but Spain’s internal political situation worsened daily, with Aragon heavily influenced by revolutionary ideas and Granada demanding independence even more strongly. This year, France changed its naval strategy, allowing it to preserve most of its fleet.\n\n                                                         <1796>\n\n        1796 officially marks the start of a three-pronged attack on Austria through the southern German principalities, Italy, and central German principalities. Initially, the plan was very successful for the French but slowed over time and was not fully completed by the end of 1796. However, the army under Napoleon’s command demonstrated success in Tyrol, driving the Austrian army out. The idea of preparing a landing in Ireland to finally crush Britain doomed the French fleet."

The initial plan of the anti-French forces was to cross the river, but it failed, and seeing this, the French decided to conclude the Treaty of Basel with Prussia, by which all lands on the left bank passed to France, and Prussia exited the war. This treaty prompted the Prussian government to seriously reform the army and prepare tactics against Napoleon. On the Spanish front, a separate peace was concluded, but Spain’s internal political situation worsened daily, with Aragon heavily influenced by revolutionary ideas and Granada demanding independence even more strongly. This year, France changed its naval strategy, allowing it to preserve most of its fleet.\n\n                                                         <1796>\n\n        1796 officially marks the start of a three-pronged attack on Austria through the southern German principalities, Italy, and central German principalities. Initially, the plan was very successful for the French but slowed over time and was not fully completed by the end of 1796. However, the army under Napoleon’s command demonstrated success in Tyrol, driving the Austrian army out. The idea of preparing a landing in Ireland to finally crush Britain doomed the French fleet."

Britain, which practically ignored the terms of the peace treaty, immediately sided with Spain. But the success with which Napoleon’s army advanced in Spain was astonishing. It was clear that by the end of the year Spain would fall, and the British would not even have time to help.\n\n                                                          <1804>\n\n       1804 was the year of Spain’s fall. At this time, Napoleon turned Spain into a puppet of Paris, and the French Republic ended its existence, transforming into the French Empire under the Bonaparte dynasty. It seemed that Spain’s wealth would help France’s economy survive this war. But even this did not help France’s budget, as French commanders sought to finally end the prolonged conflict with the British, leading not only to a crisis within Napoleon’s command but also to increased and already high taxes in both France and Spain.\n\n                                                           <1805>\n\n        By 1805, a coalition had formed against Napoleon, consisting of the Confederation of the British Isles, the Kingdom of Prussia, the Austrian Empire, and the Kingdom of Naples. The ruler of France felt he could defeat each opponent, but losing the fleet after a failed invasion of Britain could mark the beginning of the end. Although by October Napoleon’s forces were in Tyrol and advancing towards Vienna, on December 2 the Battle of Austerlitz occurred, where Russian-Austrian forces were completely crushed. After fierce fighting, Austria was forced not only to exit the war and cede some lands to France but also to dissolve the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation — a serious blow to both Austria and Russia. However, Napoleon was more friendly towards the latter and, as a gesture of reconciliation, sent Kutuzov’s captured troops back to Russia. Also, throughout 1805, Napoleon’s forces successfully advanced on the Kingdom of Naples, leading to its dissolution by year’s end and the creation of a French satellite state there."

Napoleon could not allow this to happen, so he tried to end the war. But this proved to be a fatal mistake, as at the Battle of Jena, Bonaparte was defeated due to the unexpected tactics of the Prussian army supported by the Romean volunteer legion and bad weather. While he was leaving German lands, what he feared most happened — the flag of the republic rose again over France. As soon as Bonaparte crossed the French border, he was immediately arrested by the new government. By the end of the year, work began on a peace treaty, which would later be called the Treaty of Reims.\n\n                                                         <<<Results>>>\n\n       In December 1806, a peace treaty was signed between France and the coalition. The signing took place in Reims, hence the name. According to its terms, the new government recognized the return of borders to pre-coalition war lines, but after some amendments (largely thanks to Vienna’s mediation), a pro-Austrian principality was created on the lands of Alsace and Lorraine, and the revived Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont gained control over Savoy and some borderlands. Additionally, France had to pay reparations to former anti-French coalition members. Another point of the treaty concerned the partition of Poland involving Russia, Austria, and Prussia, initiated by Vienna and Berlin. At Austria and Prussia’s “request,” Alexander Romanov had no choice but to agree.\n\n                                              State §1[PRU.GetNameWithFlag]§!\n\n       After the grand victory at Jena, the army of [PRU.GetName] continued its reforms. This time, the focus was not only on doctrine reforms but also on technology, which later led to the creation of the first “Panzers.” Also, after this victory, [PRU.GetName] became the leader of the German region, allowing it to accept the crown of all Germany in 1848.\n\n                           State §1[CBI.GetNameWithFlag]§!\n\n      After these wars, the country urgently needed reforms, so the CBI accepted the status of a war loser and began focusing on internal affairs. However, the economy and stability continued to deteriorate year by year. The British nation probably did not get what it wanted in this war."

However, by 1814 Austria sought to regain control over Germany, this time with the help of the Union of German Nations, but the plan was spoiled when Prussia gained equal rights with Austria.

The shortage of people due to deaths and bankruptcy could have destroyed the nation again, but successful Cordeliers’ reforms allowed the nation to survive.

As soon as French forces left the country, unrest began, escalating into riots and later revolutions. First, Granada broke away, led by the former Spanish dynasty, the Bourbons. Then, with French support, Aragon left Spain and established a socialist republic on its lands. Due to all these losses, Spain lost itself and became Castile again, though this time under a strict president, each trying to undo the reforms of their predecessor.\n\n                                                           The Rest of the World\n\n     The coalition wars barely changed the rest of the world, though events in Italy were perhaps the most interesting. When Sicily regained control over its remaining lands, they proclaimed the Sicilian Republic but retained the monarchical principle, promising revenge on those who destroyed their Italian dream.\n       After this 14-year war in Europe, peace came, and for 43 years (as of 1849) no major wars have occurred in Europe."

Emerging in France at the end of the 18th century, it spurred rapid industrial and scientific growth in European countries.\n      One of the most important discoveries of this period is rightfully considered “Leipoldite.” A resource consisting of small green crystals resembling quartz, discovered after the “Potsdam Incident.”\n     But before discussing the crystals themselves, it is worth mentioning the scientist after whom they were named — Jakob Leipold. Working on a general theory of mechanical engineering, he laid the fundamental foundations for steam engine creation, presented in an eight-volume work published from 1720.\n        The invention of the steam engine in 1769 renewed interest in the scientist’s work, especially among Germans, as Leipold’s theory formed the basis for the French invention. However, the first steam passenger transport appeared only in 1784, developed by Prussian engineer Johann Ernst Zeiger.\n       In 1821, after the “Potsdam Incident” involving a steam engine explosion, bright green crystal clusters were found on the engine debris.\n      Research showed the crystals had extremely unusual physical and chemical properties: when heated in a mixture, the weight of nearby objects began to decrease. However, at 240 degrees Celsius, the effect completely disappeared."

 story_decision_event.30.d:0 "      In 1826, German scientists increased the radius to 10 centimeters. But the heating problem remained unsolved, and crystal production was still very unprofitable.\n       By 1829, the Jakob Leipold engine was invented, or rather assembled, as described in his work. The engine allowed producing crystals without destroying itself, but producing 10 grams of crystals required up to 10 kilograms of coal.\n        In 1832, Prussia officially demonstrated the properties of this material to the world but withheld production technology, forcing all countries wanting the material to buy it from Prussia.\n      By 1837, at the congress of Romean, Italian, German, and French scientists, the crystals were officially named “Leipoldite,” and the production secret was revealed worldwide. However, due to cost and labor intensity, no country except Prussia could start mass production.\n      In early 1847, devices for producing “Leipoldite” in some volumes were created, allowing related technology development in countries other than Prussia.\n        In early 1848, a military research testing ground in Baden was destroyed, showing that “Leipoldite” could be used not only in mechanical engineering but also in weapons of mass destruction. Details of this incident are completely hidden by the Prussian administration, but the consequences led to the destruction of an entire city."
