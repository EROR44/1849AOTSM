 armor_tech_1:0 "Basic Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_1_desc:0 "During the Great War, tanks only needed protection from infantry weapons, so relatively thin armor sufficed. The new generation of anti-tank weapons made the battlefield much more dangerous for armored vehicles, and now they need stronger protection."
 armor_tech_2:0 "Improved Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_2_desc:0 "Now that more powerful and heavier anti-tank weapons are being deployed worldwide, the next generation of tanks will require even stronger armor."
 armor_tech_3:0 "Modernized Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_3_desc:0 "Now that the limit of anti-tank gun development seems to have been reached, the new generation of tanks will carry more effective weapons capable of penetrating any armor at long range."
 armor_tech_4:0 "Modern Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_4_desc:0 "The dangers to tanks on the battlefield have multiplied: from enemy tanks, anti-tank guns, special anti-tank equipment to modern infantry weapons firing shaped charges capable of penetrating even heavy armor. We must develop new protection methods to safeguard tanks from new threats."
 engine_tech_1:0 "Basic Engine"
 engine_tech_1_desc:0 "Great War tanks were heavy and clumsy, but modern tanks need speed and mobility to win."
