 war_event.1.d:0 "Representatives of the anti-Hungarian coalition have come to us asking for assistance in their struggle for their national lands. One thing is clear now: the war between them has already begun, so we must decide whether to provide them help or immediately say that we are unable to assist.\nMany of our politicians say we must help, as this will increase our influence in the region. However, the military argue that we should avoid involvement in this conflict, as helping may provoke Germany or Romea into conflict with us."

 war_event.2.d:0 "Our delegation has returned from Russia with very good news! Russia agrees to help us, not only financially but also with limited military support. This is the best that could have happened.\nOur government is already preparing documents to further strengthen relations with Russia, naturally after the war. With this help, our people will not feel the hardships of war as much as Hungary!"
 war_event.2.a:0 "Together to victory!"
 
 war_event.3.t:0 "Russia Refuses!"
 war_event.3.d:0 "Our delegation was gone for quite a while, but when they returned, it was clear they brought sad news. And as we feared, the news was indeed bad... Russia refused us any form of assistance, and now we are alone against Hungary!\nNo one was ready for this turn of events, putting us in a very disadvantageous position. Experts say our supplies will run out much faster than Hungary’s. It seems it’s time to pack our bags..."

 war_event.4.d:0 "As soon as the conflict with Hungary ended, our people informed us that they boarded the first train home.

 war_event.6.d:0 "We won the conflict and now have prisoners of war not only from our enemies but also those who decided to help them — namely Russian soldiers. They were in the conflict illegally, so we have the right to simply arrest them.\nOur government asks to return the prisoners home to avoid conflict with Russia, but the military argue otherwise, saying that if we make Germany our ally, we should not fear Russian aggression."

 war_event.7.d:0 "Today those who recently went to fight against Hungary returned, though not in full numbers, but we lost the conflict. We are lucky that Hungary decided to return our soldiers.\nAfter rest, our commanders should question them about Hungarian tactics and enemy division behavior. Our army is not at its peak now, so we must learn something new this way."

 war_russian.1.d:0 "        With the start of the Warsaw assault, interethnic tension was already in the air, but a few days after the full-scale military actions began, some of our divisions started committing robberies in Polish territory.\n\n       Although we are officially at war with Poland, does that allow our soldiers to commit such acts against our former citizens? Some officers are ready to resign if we continue to turn a blind eye to these atrocities."

In it, Ignatiev described the situation in the Volga lands, where the majority population are Volga Germans, emphasizing that he considers them enemies of our state.\n\n     His plan outlines ways to resolve this issue, but he clearly wants it solved once and for all. On one hand, such a step will show us in a bad light, but on the other, it will solve the problem of potential separatism. It will also temporarily push the Black League away from the front, which will reduce war crimes."

The documents list the main oppressions as: disgraceful regiments, being pelted with stones and sticks. Such behavior clearly results from growing hostility of our population towards Russians.\n\n      But the main question is whether we should turn a blind eye to this? Our people may satisfy their bloodlust now, and when the war ends, they can peacefully accept the Russians back. On the other hand, if we allow this to happen, there is a chance we will nurture nationalism among our youth by showing them we do not oppose such actions."

 war_prussian.2.d:0 "       The command of the “Black Sun” came to us with an interesting proposal. They want us to organize a march of Russian prisoners of war. By doing so, they believe we can show everyone that we keep prisoners in decent conditions. Moreover, they want the prisoners to march through the main square of Berlin.\n\n     However, under international law, such actions may be considered a war crime. Also, the march would be organized by the “Black Sun” itself, which would increase their influence. Our military supports this, as it would demonstrate our strength to neighbors. But democratic forces argue that this crosses the line between a civilized state and a state of barbarians."

 war_russian_czapski.1.d:0 "        Events in Novgorod have reached their peak. It all started with marches against the war throughout the city, and today the governor made a loud statement in the center of Novgorod. His speech will probably be remembered for a very long time.\n\n – “Citizens of Russia! Our government has taken a desperate step and started a war against most of the world! How can we support them in such an aggressive step? I want to ask you, do Russians want war? No, we don’t want war! After all, then we will have to wait for an answer from silence! I believe that we urgently need to stop the war and allow Poland to become independent; it is their right under our constitution. But I tried to do everything I could, but it didn’t work out. The government refused to stop the war, and therefore I will have to leave my post. Today, our country is entering an era from which it may not emerge. Please do everything in your power to protect yourself and your loved ones.”\n\n        After these words, he left the podium and went to his apartment. And protests against the war began throughout the city. Emeryk Hutten-Czapski clearly ignited the people, but not against our enemy, but against us!"

 war_russian_czapski.2.d:0 "        After Emeryk Hutten-Czapski’s speech, protests swept across the country, but now everything is getting worse. Namely, more and more of our citizens are becoming supporters of this traitor. Now, clashes have begun throughout our country with those who oppose our government.\n\n        Now we are forming the so-called new Northern Society. It’s unclear how bad everything is, but one thing is clear: his supporters will not let us live in peace.\n\n        The government is already preparing a bill against pacifists and traitors to the motherland."

 war_russian_czapski.3.t:0 "Czapski Discontent"
 war_russian_czapski.3.d:0 "        The moment has come when peaceful protests have turned into armed confrontations. Now clashes are taking place in many northern cities, and the results are not on our side. Protests are becoming more active every day, which is already a huge problem.\n\n      Now, the main battles are taking place in Novgorod, but there are fears that similar protests will spread to Petrograd! Our forces can still contain the Czapskists, but there is a possibility that this parity will not last long.\n\n        The government continues to call for peace in such a difficult hour for the country. Because when a country stands before an abyss, you should not rock the boat."

 war_russian_czapski.4.d:0 "        Your Excellency! Intelligence reported to us that the former governor of Novgorod, Emerek Hutten-Czapski, who openly supported the speedy end to the armed conflict, has disappeared somewhere.\n\n      Discontent with the actions of our government is strong, including thanks to his efforts, so the disappearance of such a problematic person from our field of vision does not bode well for us. Therefore, we should do everything possible to prevent what could become fatally dangerous for our government in the bud."

Yes, we hate what they say, but we will stand to the end for them to have the right to this worldview."

 war_russian_czapski.6.d:0 "        Officials and ruling circles from Novgorod, led by Czapski, decided to express a vote of no confidence in our government, using their right guaranteed by our set of laws, due to the lack of significant victories at the front and the war itself, which has turned into a protracted one, and also because its end is not in sight.\n\n     This effectively means that if we continue to fight further without achieving significant success, then the local government will declare us an illegitimate power, which is fraught with extremely dire consequences for our entire Motherland..."

 #Leupoldit Strike
 
 war_pru_leupoldit_strike.1.t:0 "Final Preparations"
 war_pru_leupoldit_strike.1.d:0 "     German pilots are preparing to carry out an important mission involving the use of a new type of bombs on key targets of the British Isles Confederation. The command is conducting the final inspection of aircraft and equipment to ensure their functionality and absence of malfunctions during the flight. Engineers are working to eliminate remaining minor defects to minimize the risk of failure.\n       Aviation commanders are discussing all possible scenarios with pilots, including weather conditions, navigation systems, and potential threats along the routes. Each pilot receives individual instructions regarding the route, targets, and behavior in case of unforeseen circumstances. Mission leaders emphasize that this mission is unique and not to be repeated, which increases pressure on the pilots.\n       The main goal of the mission is to damage key enemy facilities such as military-industrial plants and command centers. Destroying these targets will significantly reduce their ability to sustain combat operations, providing Germany with a substantial advantage or even a swift victory."
 war_pru_leupoldit_strike.1.a:0 "Can't wait to start the mission"
 
 war_pru_leupoldit_strike.2.t:0 "Time to Begin"
 war_pru_leupoldit_strike.2.d:0 "     The silence of the airfield is broken by the roar of engines. Mechanics hurry to complete the last checks before takeoff. The aircraft hoods gleam under the morning sun, and pilots check their equipment, preparing for the important mission. All conversations cease as the squadron commander raises his hand, signaling the start of the operation.\n       Concentration fills the bombers' cockpits. Navigators check maps, confirming the route, while bombardiers adjust their instruments. Fighters, ready to escort and protect the heavy planes, take positions nearby. Their engines roar like predators awaiting their prey.\n       One by one, the aircraft begin moving down the runway. Wheels leave the ground, and the first fighters soar into the sky, leaving trails of smoke behind. Bombers follow, slowly gaining altitude. The squadron forms a combat formation, and within minutes the entire group disappears beyond the horizon, heading toward the designated target.\n       The radio is silent, with only occasional commands reminding pilots of their task. The sky seems endless, but ahead lies an important mission, the success of which depends on every second and every decision. Only two points remain in the sky — bombers surrounded by a cloud of twenty fighters ready to defend them at any cost."

German aircraft have formed an unusual formation not previously observed. Scouts immediately relayed the information to command, noting that such a formation may indicate preparation for a new tactic or operation.\n       Command is reviewing the received data with special attention. It is possible that Germany is preparing an unexpected move, and it is important to understand what threats this may pose. It was decided to increase airspace surveillance and be ready for any surprises.\n       The decision to begin countermeasures rests with the Lord Protector, and many expect the order to be given as soon as possible..."

The enemy demonstrated unexpected tactics and high maneuverability, allowing them to bypass British interceptors and air defense systems. Now they are moving toward their targets almost unhindered.\n       Command realizes the seriousness of the situation. Air defense resources are exhausted, and there are insufficient reserves to organize effective protection. Remaining forces are put on high alert, but hopes for a successful repulsion of the attack fade with every moment. All that remains is to wait and hope for a miracle."

Thanks to the decisive actions of the British Air Force and a fortunate turn of events, most of the enemy air fleet was shot down right over the waters of the English Channel. The remnants of the squadrons are scattered and no longer pose a significant threat.\n       The news of victory quickly reached the command of the British Isles Confederation. The generals breathed a sigh of relief, understanding that this crisis had been overcome. They immediately began boosting troop morale, reminding soldiers of the importance of their efforts and urging them to prepare for new victories. Despite the temporary weakening of defensive positions, confidence in their own strength returned, and the army is ready to face new challenges with heads held high."

Maps and diagrams are spread across tables, but the generals' eyes are fixed on the radio, awaiting any signal from the front. Instead of the long-awaited message of mission success, a shocking report arrives: the aircraft sent to carry out one of the most important operations have been destroyed in the skies over the English Channel.\n       Tension hangs in the air. Commanders exchange glances, trying to comprehend what happened. No messages have come from the pilots, and not a single aircraft has returned. Even the fighters assigned to provide cover have disappeared from the radars, leaving behind only emptiness and silence.\n       The generals understand that this loss is a true catastrophe. The operation, on which so many hopes were pinned, ended in complete failure. The strategic advantage, for which the lives of the best pilots were risked, is lost.\n       The commander takes the floor, trying to calm his subordinates, but his voice sounds uncertain. Panic gradually spreads through the headquarters. Questions come one after another: “How could this happen?” “What do we do next?” “Who is to blame for this defeat?” Answers are hard to find, as everyone understood the high stakes of this operation. Now the future looks bleak, and the leadership is forced to reconsider the entire military plan. The mood in the headquarters grows increasingly tense, and no one knows what the next step will be."

To the surprise of many, the German command headquarters received a signal from one of the bombers: the bomb was successfully dropped! A few seconds later, another signal came — the second bomber also completed its task. Joyful cheers echoed throughout the headquarters.\n       But the joy only grew when reports came from units stationed in Belgium. They said they saw the shockwave and explosion flash even from there. This news finally convinced the command of the mission’s success. All doubts were dispelled, giving way to jubilation.\n       The leadership immediately sent their congratulations to the pilots and everyone involved in preparing and conducting the operation. This moment became a turning point in the war, and everyone knew that this success would change a lot. The mood in the headquarters sharply shifted, and everyone felt a surge of confidence and pride in the achieved result."

At first, this caused slight concern, but soon terrifying reports began to arrive at the British command headquarters in Birmingham. Survivors reported colossal explosions that literally wiped cities off the face of the earth. It became clear that Germany had indeed created a weapon of unprecedented destructive power and used it today.\n       Panic spread throughout the country. People could not believe what was happening. London and Liverpool, the two largest cities of the Confederation, lay in ruins. No one could predict what would happen next. The British command was paralyzed by fear and uncertainty. What would happen if the Germans decided to use this weapon again? How to defend against such a devastating strike? These questions remained unanswered, and the entire country fell into a state of shock and despair."

 war_pru_leupoldit_strike.9.d:0 "     Suddenly, without any warning, both German bombers and their escorting aircraft stopped communicating. The German command headquarters began frantic work analyzing the situation. Specialists tried to determine the cause, considering possible scenarios.\n       One theory was a technical malfunction on one of the planes that led to loss of contact. However, the absence of reports of air battles suggested another possibility — perhaps some pilots betrayed the mission. The leadership wondered if someone on the crew deliberately disabled the communication system to hide their true intentions.\n       While command tries to understand what happened, anxiety and uncertainty grow. What happened to the planes? Where are they headed? What plans are hidden behind this sudden silence? Answers remain unknown, and the situation remains extremely tense."

 war_pru_leupoldit_strike.10.t:0 "Threat Disappeared from Radar"
 war_pru_leupoldit_strike.10.d:0 "     British forces’ radars stopped detecting the presence of German bombers. This caused mixed feelings among the command. On one hand, it was hard to imagine the planes simply vanished. On the other hand, slight concerns arose: what if this is part of a clever German plan?\n       However, with each passing hour, it became clearer that the German threat had indeed disappeared on its own. Nothing appeared on radar screens, no signals were received. Gradually, tension began to ease, and the British command started leaning toward the idea that the danger had passed.\n       Nevertheless, the full understanding of the reasons for the planes’ disappearance remained a mystery. Perhaps an incident occurred leading to a crash or communication system failure. Or maybe the German pilots decided to abort the mission on their own initiative. Whatever the reason, the main thing is that the threat is gone, and now it is necessary to assess the situation and prepare for possible further actions."
