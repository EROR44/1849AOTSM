 bul_first_balkan_army:0 "First Balkan Army"
 bul_first_balkan_army_desc:0 "To date, the Bulgaro-Wallachian Kingdom possesses the strongest army in the Balkans. Modern weaponry, high troop discipline, and effective military organization allow the state to dominate the region and set standards of combat power. The army plays a key role in ensuring the country's security and defense capability, maintaining Bulgaro-Wallachia's status as a leading regional power."

 bul_rising_power:0 "Rising Power"
 bul_rising_power_desc:0 "Year by year, the Bulgaro-Wallachian Kingdom strengthens its influence in the Balkans, becoming one of the leading regional powers. Policies of expanding trade relations, army modernization, and support for national movements contribute to the growth of the state's international authority. Nevertheless, the Bulgaro-Wallachian leadership clearly understands that regional leadership is only an intermediate stage on the path to achieving greater influence and recognition on the world stage."

 bul_anti_serbian_sentiment:0 "Anti-Serbian Sentiment"
 bul_anti_serbian_sentiment_desc:0 "In recent years, relations between the Bulgaro-Wallachian Kingdom and Serbia have sharply deteriorated. The escalation of border conflicts and aggravation of territorial disputes have led to serious complications in bilateral relations. Incidents at the borders caused by actions of Serbian military personnel and intelligence services occur increasingly often. The population of Bulgaro-Wallachia views these events negatively, generating a growing wave of anti-Serbian sentiment throughout the country."
